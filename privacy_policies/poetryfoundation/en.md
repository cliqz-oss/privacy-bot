*Other Information Collected.* TPF automatically gathers aggregate statistical information about this Website and its visitors, such as browsers used, pages viewed, number of visitors, etc.

**Use of the Personal Information

*Sharing with Third Parties.*TPF does not rent or sell your personally identifying information.

These companies will use your information solely to provide these services to us. We may also, but only with your permission, share the personally identifying information of users who reside within the United States with reputable organizations that offer information and programming that we think may be of interest to you. If you wish for us to share your information for these reasons, please check the "opt-in" box on our sign-up page, or contact us at <mail@poetryfoundation.org>.

*Guidelines for Transfer of Personal Information.* TPF will only transfer personal information to third parties consistent with the principles of notice and choice set forth in the European Commission's Directive on Data Protection ("EC Directive"). Where TPF has not provided for a choice, because our use of the personal information is compatible with the purpose for which the data was originally collected or which was disclosed in a notice, TPF will transfer the data to a third-party only if TPF first either (a) ascertains that the third party subscribes to the Safe Harbor principles or is subject to the EC Directive, or (b) enters into a written agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor principles.

*Exceptions.* Notwithstanding the limitations on transfer of personal information set forth above, TPF will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on TPF or this Website; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of TPF; and (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of employees of TPF, users of this Website, or the public.

**Opt-Out
***Opt-Out Procedure.*Users of this Website are given the opportunity to 'opt-in' to have their information used for purposes not directly related to this Website and may choose to provide information to take advantage of TPF's services related to this Website.

*Effect of Opting-Out.* Upon receipt of such notification, TPF will, within a commercially reasonable time, either: (a) remove you and your personal information from TPF database (which may affect your ability to use the Website); (b) correct any personal information that you state is erroneous; or (c) permit you to "opt-out" of further e-mail contact (excepting notification of major changes to the service) while still allowing access to this Website; as directed by you.

You should be aware that these linked external or third-party Websites are not controlled by TPF and, therefore, are not subject to this Privacy Policy. TPF is not responsible for these other, linked Websites, including the privacy practices of such other Websites. You are responsible for checking the privacy policies of these third party sites to determine how your personal information may be utilized by the proprietors of those third-party Websites.

**Intellectual Property
**You acknowledge and agree that all content included on or through the Website, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, videos, logos, buttons, icons, images, software and the selection and arrangement thereof (collectively, "Materials"), is the property of TPF or its licensors and are subject to and protected by United States and international copyright and other intellectual property laws and rights.

The Trademarks may not be used in connection with any product or service that does not belong to TPF or in any manner that is likely to cause confusion about whether TPF is the source, sponsor, or endorser of the product or service and may not be used in any manner that disparages or discredits TPF.

Any user failing to comply with these guidelines may be expelled from, and refused continued access to the public forums on the Website in the future. TPF or its designated agents may remove or alter any user-created content at any time for any reason. Materials posted and/or uploaded to the various public forums may be subject to size and usage limitations. You are responsible for adhering to such limitations. TPF expressly disclaims all responsibility and endorsement and make no representation as to the validity of any opinion, advice, information or statement made or displayed in these forums by third parties, nor are we responsible for any errors or omissions in such postings, or for hyperlinks embedded in any messages. Under no circumstances will TPF, its affiliates, licensors, suppliers or agents be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on information obtained through these forums. The opinions expressed in these forums are solely the opinions of the participants, and do not reflect the opinions of TPF. TPF has no obligation whatsoever to monitor any of the content or postings on the message boards, chat rooms or other public forums. However, you acknowledge and agree that we reserve the right to monitor the same at our sole discretion. In addition, we reserve the right to alter, edit, refuse to post or remove any postings or content, in whole or in part, for any reason and to disclose such materials and the circumstances surrounding their transmission to any third party in order to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request and to protect ourselves, our sponsors, users and visitors.

You further agree to grant TPF a worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to store, use, transmit, display, publish, reproduce, or otherwise distribute your comments without limitation, as well as to make such additional uses of them as may be needed by TPF or any affiliated entity.

**Links to the Website, Frames and Metatags
**You may not link to the home page of the Website in any way that might cast TPF in a false or misleading light. You may not frame the Website content so that it is viewed on another site. You may not use metatags or any other "hidden text" that incorporates the name "The Poetry Foundation" or the Trademarks without our express written consent.

**Linked Websites
**This Website may contain hyperlinks to sites owned and operated by parties other than TPF. Such hyperlinks are provided only for ready reference and ease of use. We do not control such Websites and are not responsible for their contents. The inclusion of hyperlinks on our Website does not mean that we endorse or approve of any third party site to which you may have access through the linked Websites. We accept no liability for any information, products or services contained in, or which may be linked to through, these third party sites or for any action you may take as a result of linking to any such site. Each of the sites to which you may link are likely to set forth specific terms and conditions of use that you should review. Please review the terms of use and privacy policy of any linked site.

**Indemnification
**You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless TPF, its directors, officers, employees, agents, licensors, attorneys, independent contractors, providers, subsidiaries, and affiliates (collectively, "TPF and Affiliates") from and against any and all claim, loss, expense, or demand or liability, including attorneys' fees and costs, incurred by TPF and Affiliates arising out of (i) any claim by a third party relating to the posting, distribution, modification, or alteration by you of any content, or (ii) your use of the Website in violation of these Terms of Use or in violation of any applicable law.

You agree to cooperate with us as reasonably required in the defense of any such claims. TPF and Affiliates reserve the right, at their own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and you shall not in any event settle any such claim or matter without the written consent of TPF.

**Security
**The Internet is an open network that is not secure. There is an inherent risk that any transmission via the Internet may be intercepted, modified, misdirected, or not be delivered to the intended recipient. There is also an inherent risk that information stored on a computer connected to the Internet may be accessed without authorization. Although we take reasonable means to protect the security of the information communicated through the Website, no Internet-connected computer system can be made absolutely secure from intrusion. We, therefore, cannot and do not guarantee that information displayed on our Website has not been modified by others without authorization or that information communicated by you to us will be received or that it will not be altered before or after its transmission to us. If you elect to use this Website to communicate with us, you do so at your own risk.

If you access the Website by registering and creating an account, you must complete the registration process by creating a username and password and providing TPF with current, complete and accurate information, as prompted by the applicable registration form. You are solely responsible for guarding the secrecy of your username and its related password. We encourage you to change your password frequently. Although by diligence and care you may reduce the risk of unauthorized use of your username and password, such risk may not be eliminated. Again, we are not responsible for unauthorized access to the Website; if you elect to use this Website, you, and you alone, have assumed the risk of doing so.

**Privacy
**We are committed to respecting your privacy and that of the information you provide to us. By using this Website, you consent to the processing of personal information about you as described in the Privacy Policy for this Website, which is hereby incorporated by reference within these Terms of Use.

WE TAKE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU IS USED CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIVACY POLICY. HOWEVER, THE INTERNET IS AN OPEN SYSTEM AND WE CANNOT AND DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION ENTERED BY YOU WILL NOT BE MISAPPROPRIATED, INTERCEPTED, MODIFIED, DELETED, DESTROYED, OR USED BY OTHERS. YOU AGREE NOT TO HOLD THE POETRY FOUNDATION AND ITS AFFILIATES LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY SORT INCURRED AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH MISAPPROPRIATION, INTERCEPTION, MODIFICATION, DELETION, DESTRUCTION, OR USE OF INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THIS WEBSITE.

**Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notification of Alleged Copyright Infringement.
**TPF avails itself of the protection of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We reserve the right to remove any content or links that allegedly infringe another person's copyright.

You agree to destroy or erase any such copy, if TPF requests that you do so.

**Warranty and Liability Disclaimer
**THIS WEBSITE IS PROVIDED AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS. WE GIVE NO WARRANTIES IN RESPECT OF THIS WEBSITE WHATSOEVER.

**Remedies for Misuse
**You agree that any unauthorized use of the Website or its contents may cause TPF and Affiliates immediate and irreparable harm for which money damages may not constitute an adequate remedy.

IN NO EVENT SHALL LIABILITY FOR LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PRECLUDE LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY OTHER REMEDY.

**Governing Law
**These Terms of Use, including the Privacy Policy incorporated by reference, and any claim or dispute relating to it will be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois applicable to contracts made and performed there without regard to its conflicts of law principles.

**Termination
**We reserve the right to terminate these Terms of Use, including the Privacy Policy incorporated by reference, at any time without notice for any reason or for no reason, including for any user's violation of any of the provisions of the Terms of Use. The Limitation of Liability and Governing Law sections of these Terms of Use shall survive any such termination.

**General Terms and Conditions
**If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall continue in effect.
