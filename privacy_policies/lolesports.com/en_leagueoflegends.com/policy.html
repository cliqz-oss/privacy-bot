<br /><p>
    Welcome to Riot Games!  Our privacy policy explains what info Riot Games collects when you visit the Riot services, as well as ways we might use or share it.  Note that we’re only describing our own practices – this policy doesn’t apply to third parties, including other companies you might interact with on or through the Riot services (see <a href="#third-party">Third-Party Websites and Services</a>).
</p>
<p>
    When we say “Riot Games,” we’re referring to Riot Games, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  We’re a global gaming company headquartered in Los Angeles with offices and operations around the world (see <a href="#international-data">International Data Processing</a>).  When we reference “the Riot services,” we mean League of Legends and any other games, websites, applications, and services that link to this policy, regardless of how you access or use them, including through mobile devices.
</p> 
<p>
    Our privacy policy is part of the <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a> for the Riot services in your region, which are incorporated by reference. This means your visit is also subject to the <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a> (including its provisions regarding limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of governing law).  Please review all relevant terms, and make sure you understand and agree to them, before using the Riot services.
</p>
<p>
    READ THIS ENTIRE POLICY CAREFULLY!  BY USING THE RIOT SERVICES, YOU’RE AGREEING TO THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED BELOW.
</p>
<p>
    We encourage you to use the policy’s interactive features to guide you.  We’ve written summaries to identify the key issues discussed in many sections at a glance; <strong><em>however, note that these summaries are intended solely for your convenience and the full policy controls in the event of any conflicts (so be sure to read the whole thing carefully!)</em></strong>.  Click on the “Expand” buttons for further details about particular topics that interest you.  To zip between sections, use the “Back To Top” buttons and the Table of Contents below.

        <ul><li>
                You provide some of it directly (such as by completing a registration form or survey).

                We record some of it automatically (including with technologies like cookies). 
            </li><br /><li>
                We receive some of it from third parties (like social media companies).

        <h3>
            A. Info You Provide
        </h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Summary:</strong>  We collect data you choose to provide or give to us in any manner.  You don’t have to share personal info when we ask you for it, but if you decline, you might not be able to access certain Riot services or take advantage of their full functionality.
        </p>
        <br /><div id="accordion" class="ui-accordion">

                <p>
                    For example, you’ll need a valid Riot Games account to play League of Legends and access parts of our websites.  If you’d like to create one, we’ll ask you to complete our online <a href="https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/index?realm_key=na">registration form</a>, which requests info like a unique username and password, your email address, and your date of birth.  You’ll also need to choose a public-facing Summoner Name to associate with certain account activity, like your in-game performance and forum posts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ask you for payment-related info to process purchases you make on the Riot services (see <a href="#what-info">What Info We Collect</a>).  In most cases, we’ll also need to share that info with third-party vendors (like PayOn) to facilitate payment processing (see <a href="#third-party">Vendors and Service Providers</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other common ways you might provide us with info include: responding to surveys; participating in contests or similar promotions; requesting products or services from us; and using interactive features like forums or in-game chat.

            <strong>Summary:</strong> We and our partners also automatically record some info about how you use and navigate the Riot services, including through technologies like cookies.  Among other things, this helps us analyze, improve, and secure the Riot services, as well as support our advertising efforts.  We may combine automatically-collected info with other info we gather from or about you as described in this policy.

                <p>
                    <em>(1) LOG FILES</em>.  We automatically gather info about the ways you interact with the Riot services and store it in log files.  This may include, for example, Usage Info (see <a href="#what-info">What Info We Collect</a>) about your visit, like data that your device or browser sends to us when you access the Riot services and details about how you use your Riot Games account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>(2) COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</em>. “Cookies” are small pieces of data that online services you use place on your device for record-keeping purposes.  “Web beacons” are transparent pixel images that allow online services to collect info about the ways you interact with them (like whether you’ve opened an email or clicked on an ad).  Other common tracking technologies include things like tags, scripts, local shared objects (e.g., Flash cookies), local storage (e.g., HTML5), and similar tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Riot services use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to automatically collect, store, and read files on your device.  They may be delivered in a first-party (i.e., by Riot Games) or third-party (i.e., by other companies) context.  These tools help the Riot services work and operate more efficiently, as well as capture Usage Info (see <a href="#what-info">What Info We Collect</a>) and similar data about your browsing experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use info gathered through tracking technologies for several reasons, including:
                </p>
                <ul><li>
                        To monitor, secure, and maintain the Riot services;
                    </li><br /><li>
                        To enhance your browsing experience;
                    </li><br /><li>
                        To analyze and improve our operations (like aggregating traffic and usage patterns);
                    </li><br /><li>
                        To control the display of ads, including providing you with targeted offers;
                    </li><br /><li>

                    <em>(3)  ANALYTICS PROVIDERS AND INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING</em>.  In addition to the tracking technologies we place, other companies may set their own cookies or similar tools when you visit the Riot services.  This includes vendors we’ve engaged to provide services on our behalf (like website analytics), as well as third parties that deliver content (like videos from YouTube) or offers (like ads from ad networks) contained on the Riot services.  We may receive reports based on our partners’ use of these tools on an individual or aggregate basis. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, we use third-party analytics providers like Google Analytics to help evaluate and report on use of the Riot services.  These companies may set and read their own tracking technologies to gather info about your online activities across websites and services.  Some analytics providers offer you choices about how they collect and use data directly on their websites.

                    We also partner with ad companies to support our marketing efforts, including by serving you ads better tailored to your likely interests (such as based on your browsing activity on the Riot services or when visiting other online services).

If you click on links to external websites or services that are operated by third parties, they may collect, use, and share your personal info pursuant to their own policies (not ours).

                        <em>Social Media Features</em>.  The Riot services use interfaces with social media companies to provide features that facilitate social sharing and connections (such as the Facebook “Like” button and other widgets).  These features may collect info about your interactions with them and the Riot services, and may use tracking technologies like cookies to function properly.  How social media companies process your info is controlled by their own privacy policies.

                        <em>Third-Party Tracking</em>.  The Riot services contain cookies, web beacons, and other common tracking technologies that help us collect and analyze info in connection with your visit (see <a href="#info-auto">Info We Collect Automatically</a>). Third parties (like analytics providers or ad networks) may set and read their own tracking technologies on the Riot services.

                    Some newer Internet browsers incorporate “Do Not Track” features.  If activated, these features often send a signal to the services you visit indicating that you don’t want to be tracked in some way.  Those services (or content on them placed by third parties) may continue to engage in activities you may view as tracking even though you’ve expressed this preference, depending on the service’s privacy practices.                  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Riot Games does not currently respond to browser DNT signals on the Riot services.

                <ul><li>
                        <em>Limit personal info you share.</em>  The main way we collect personal info is when you give it to us voluntarily.  You can choose to browse some parts of the Riot services without ever creating an account, purchasing products or services, or otherwise submitting personal info to Riot Games (see <a href="#info-you">Info You Provide</a>).  If you do provide us with personal info, we generally retain it as long as your account is active or as is otherwise necessary to provide the Riot services and operate our business (including for purposes like complying with our legal obligations, managing internal books and records, preventing fraud, resolving disputes, and enforcing our contracts and terms, such as this policy and the <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a>), unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by law. 
                    </li><br /><li>
                        <em>Access or delete your personal info.</em>   If you’re concerned with the way we’re handling your personal info, or would like to update or delete it, <a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a>.  We’ll respond to requests to access or delete your personal info within 30 days.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal info, but we’ll let you know why.  Note that requesting deletion of your personal info may also result in account termination.
                    </li><br /><li>
                        <em>Update your communication preferences.</em>  While we offer players the option to receive updates and promotional communications from Riot Games, you can change your preferences at any time.  To opt-out, simply “unsubscribe” by following the instructions in any of our promotional emails.  These choices don’t apply to mandatory communications that are part of the Riot services, like important account-related notices.
                    </li><br /><li>
                        <em>Change your browser settings.</em>  Many Internet browsers allow you to reject, manage, and delete cookies.  You may also be able to manage other forms of tracking technologies, like HTML5, by changing your browser settings (see <a href="#info-auto">Info We Collect Automatically</a>).
                    </li><br /><li>
                        <em>Control third-party tracking.</em>  Ad companies, analytics providers, and similar third parties place their own tracking technologies on the Riot services (see <a href="#info-auto">Info We Collect Automatically</a>). If you don’t want to take advantage of the services that such tracking technologies provide, you may be able to opt-out by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info">http://www.aboutads.info</a> or <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>, or if you’re located in the EU, <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a>. Some companies also allow you to opt-out by contacting them directly.
                    </li><br /><li>
                        <em>Update your third-party privacy settings.</em>  If you authorize third-party services to share info with us, you may be able to control the types of info they make available by directly updating your privacy settings on their service.  For example, if you link your social media account with the Riot services, your privacy settings on the social media company’s service determine what info we receive (see <a href="#info-other">Other Sources</a>).
