<h3 id="information-collection-and-use" class="sub-title">Information Collection and Use</h3>
<p>Newegg.com is the sole owner of information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to any outside parties, except as outlined in this policy. We collect information from our customers to process orders and better serve you with pertinent information, such as order confirmations and order status updates. Information collected includes your name, shipping address, billing address, telephone numbers, e-mail address, and payment information such as your credit card number. We also require you to submit a username and password of your choice for your future access to your account information. To safeguard that your user name and password remain confidential, DO NOT share this information with anyone. If you elect to receive our newsletter or special promotions, your contact information will be used for the delivery of these items. We allow third-party companies to collect non-personally identifiable information when customers visit our site. These companies typically use a cookie or web beacon to collect this information in order to provide advertisements likely to be of interest to you. Our site does not respond to “Do Not Track” signals or mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="registration" class="sub-title">Registration</h3>
<p>In order to process your orders placed on this website, you must first complete the registration form. During registration, you will be required to provide your contact information, which includes your name, e-mail address, telephone number and street address. This information is used to provide you with important Newegg.com services such as automated order status updates via e-mail.</p>
<h3 id="order" class="sub-title">Order</h3>
<p>Most of the information collected in the registration process will be used to process orders. During the order process, you will have to provide financial information such as your credit card number, expiration date, money order, wire transfer or check information. This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill your order. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this contact information to get in touch with you. To properly process your credit card information, we must share your personal and financial information with the merchant bank for authorization and approval. This process is protected by an enhanced security system. See the Security section below for more details on security measures and procedures. We do not share your personal and financial information with any third parties, except those specified in the Sharing section of this policy.</p>
<h3 id="cookies" class="sub-title">Cookies</h3>
<p>We customize certain Web page content based upon your browser type and other information provided by our cookie. If you choose to reject the cookie, you can still browse our store but will be unable to use the shopping cart to buy merchandise. The Newegg.com shopping cart cannot function without cookies enabled so that the necessary information to process your order is retained. If you disable cookies, Newegg.com will be unable to accept your online order. We will not share any personally identifiable information provided by this cookie with any third party. We will, however, link data stored in cookies to the personally identifiable information you submitted while on our site. This allows us to personalize your shopping experience and discern user preferences to evoke subconscious feelings of familiarity and assurance.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.</p></li>
<li><p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by <a href="http://www.newegg.com/">Newegg.com</a> only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p></li>

<h3 id="log-files" class="sub-title">Log Files</h3>
<p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information, and we do not distribute or share IP information with any third parties.</p>
<h3 id="sharing" class="sub-title">Sharing</h3>
<p>We may employ third party companies to perform functions on our behalf. These functions may include order fulfillment, package delivery, marketing assistance, postal and e-mail delivery, customer service, data analysis, and credit processing. The third parties we contract for these purposes have limited access to your personal information and may not use it for other purposes.</p>
<p>We may frame or mask another website so that the look, feel and interface simulate the experience of browsing a genuine Newegg.com web page. Extreme care and discretion is exercised when evaluating third party sites. We only brand third party sites if their organization applies stringent security and privacy practices which parallel our own commitment to safe online shopping.</p>
<p>As our business continues to evolve, we may acquire or sell business units or subsidiaries. Customer information is one of the business assets that would be transferred in these types of transactions. In such a situation, your personally identifiable information would only be used in a manner consistent with our pre-existing Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law, and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.</p>

<p>By posting your comment(s) or testimonial(s) (&quot;Testimonial&quot;) on our website, you give us permission to reprint or use the Testimonial in connection with our business.
