Google Analytics  
  
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc.
("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files which are
saved on your computer and which allow website usage to be analyzed. The
information created by the cookies about your use of this website (including
your IP address in anonymous form) is transferred to a Google server in the
USA and saved there. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of
the website, in order to compile reports about website activity for the
website operator and to produce additional services related to website and
internet usage. Google may also communicate this information to third parties,
where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the
information on Google behalf. You can avoid the installation of cookies by
appropriately adjusting your browser software; however, we point out that in
this case you may not be able to make full use of all the features of this
website. By using this website, you agree that the data that Google collects
about you may be processed in the way described above and for the above-
mentioned purpose.  
  
  
  
1\. Sites covered by this privacy statement  
  
This privacy statement covers all websites and domains owned by LOVOO, as well
as websites and domains of fully owned subsidiaries of LOVOO.  
  
Links to websites of third-party providers  
  
On the LOVOO website you may find links to websites of third-party providers
(for example, the "Like" button on Facebook, links to fan pages on Facebook,
LinkedIn etc.) by which you can easily access further information or other
relevant websites. By clicking on these links you leave the LOVOO website.
LOVOO has no control whatsoever over these websites or their data protection
practices, which may differ from LOVOO´s practices. By linking to third-party
websites LOVOO does not endorse or support in any way the content contained
there, excluding the personal data which it has made available to these third-
party providers, or which has been collected by them and is not covered by
LOVOO´s data protection statement. You should therefore read through the data
protection statement of all companies before disclosing personal information.  
  
  
  
2\. Collection of personal data  
  
LOVOO collects, exports and uses personal data with the objective of improving
our services and understanding better your needs and interests. This is done
only with respective notice and with consent of those concerned, as well as
the submission of any required documents with data protection authorities. For
example, if you order products or services, request information, subscribe to
marketing or support materials, register, take part in competitions or
surveys, or apply for a job at LOVOO, we will ask you for personal information
required to complete this transaction. Personal information provided by you on
these pages may include your name, address, telephone number and email
address, as well as other unique information such as user Ids and passwords,
transaction information, your product and service preferences and contact
preferences.  
  
If you use our referral service to tell a friend about our website, we will
ask you for the email address of this person and send them a single invitation
to visit the website. LOVOO uses and stores this personal information for the
sole purpose of sending this single email and to enable the blocking of
additional such messages if necessary.  
  
In addition to the information provided by you, information may also be
acquired during your visits to LOVOO websites. LOVOO uses tools for automatic
data collection such as web beacons, Google DART cookies, integrated web links
and other common tools for the collection of information. These tools collect
certain standard information that your browser sends to our website. These
include, for example, browser type and language, access times and the address
of the website from which you arrived at the LOVOO website. Your IP address,
clickstream data (i.e. the sites you look at, the links you click on and other
actions relating to LOVOO websites) and product information may also be
recorded. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when
surfing the internet and by which the web server is able to localize and
identify your computer. Computers use this IP address to communicate on the
internet and therefore enable users to surf and purchase. LOVOO may also
employ some of these tools for automatic data collection on specific emails
sent by LOVOO. These tools collect information if you open the email or click
on a link contained in the email. LOVOO also refers to commercially available
sources that are considered credible for the collection of information.
Information obtained in this way may include names, addresses, email addresses
and demographic data. Information obtained from these commercial sources may
be used alongside information acquired by LOVOO from your visits to LOVOO
websites. For example, LOVOO may compare geographical information acquired
from commercial sources with the IP address collected by the tools for
automatic data collection, in order to determine your general geographic area.  
  
  
  
3\. How is your data used?  
  
The information collected helps LOVOO to deliver a consistent and customized
experience to visitors of the website. Using the information, LOVOO is able to  
• assist you in completing a transaction or subscription;  
• provide you with information about products or services;  
• provide service and support;  
• keep you up-to-date with new services and benefits;

You have the opportunity to set your privacy settings according to your wishes
regarding the information sent to you (see Your options and privacy settings).  
  
Customer feedback posted on our website will only be used with the express
authorization of the person or company who provided the feedback.  
  
  
  
4\. Who is your data passed on to?  
  
Other than described in this statement, LOVOO does not sell, rent or lease
your personal information to third parties. LOVOO gives the following personal
information:  
LOVOO uses the services of service providers and suppliers to deliver complete
products, services and customer solutions and to assist LOVOO with marketing
and communication initiatives. These providers and suppliers include, for
example, providers of customer support and live-help and email service
providers. Service providers are under a contractual obligation to treat
information entrusted to them on behalf of LOVOO as confidential and not to
use it for any purposes other than for services provided to LOVOO. From time
to time LOVOO carries out joint marketing initiatives with other companies.
Certain LOVOO services and marketing communications are delivered at the same
time as those of other companies as part of these initiatives. For some of
these services and communications you have the opportunity to pass on your
personal information, both to LOVOO and to the other companies involved in
these initiatives. Examples of this include marketing communications from
LOVOO and other companies, or the opportunity to register online for software
products of different companies. If you prefer to give your personal
information exclusively to LOVOO, LOVOO will not pass on this information to
other companies taking part in these marketing initiatives. If you decide to
share your personal information with other companies, the handling and use of
this information falls under the respective data protection provisions of this
company.  
  
Other than in the cases described in this statement, LOVOO does not disclose
your personal information to third parties without your express authorization,
except for the following purposes:  
(i) in response to a legal request for information from police or government
authorities;  
(ii) to comply with laws, regulations, citations or court orders;  
(iii) to prevent fraud or to enforce and protect the rights and ownership of
LOVOO and its subsidiaries; or  
(iv) to protect the personal security of LOVOO members.  
Circumstances may arise where for strategic or other commercial reasons LOVOO
decides to sell, purchase, merge or carry out other restructuring. Such an
operation may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective
buyers or buyers or the obtaining of such information on the part of the
seller. In such operations LOVOO always protects the information entrusted to
the company to the greatest possible extent.  
  
  
  
5\. Children´s privacy  
  
LOVOO does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age
of 13, and LOVOO websites are not aimed at children under the age of 13. We
recommend that adults and guardians take an active role in protecting their
children in their online activities and interests.  
  
  
  
6\. Your options and privacy settings  
  
LOVOO gives you the option to receive a variety of product and service related
information. You can subscribe to certain product and service-specific
information as well as general LOVOO communications. Here you can decide for
yourself whether to receive general LOVOO information by mail or by email. You
can choose or modify options about receiving subscription or general
communications at the time of entering information or using one of the methods
mentioned in the following paragraphs. These options are not valid for
communications or notifications which do not appear in the first line of the
advertisement. These include notifications about subscription fulfillment,
contracts, support or other administrative or transaction-related information.
Email messages that you receive from LOVOO are sent in compliance with this
statement. Some email messages may use tools for automatic data collection.
Further information about this can be found under [How does LOVOO use tools
for automatic data collection?]  
  
Subscription communications  
Subscription communications are, for example, email newsletters etc. that you
have expressly requested and consented to receive. If you wish to no longer
receive such requested subscription communications you can terminate the
subscription using one of the following methods:  
• Click on the email link "Opt out" or "Unsubscribe" or follow the
instructions contained in every communication to terminate the subscription.  
• Go to the webpage(s) where you originally subscribed and follow the
instructions to terminate the subscription. You can access subscription
webpages from many LOVOO subscriptions.  
• Send an email to datenschutz[at]lovoo.com. Include your name, email address
and postal address, as well as any specific relevant information about the
LOVOO subscriptions that you no longer wish to receive.  
Please note that the refusal of certain subscription communications may affect
the LOVOO services that you have requested, where receipt of these
communications is a precondition of receiving the service.  
  
  
General LOVOO communications  
LOVOO informs its users about products, services and/or support through its
general communications. This includes information about new products, special
offers or invitations to participate in user surveys, among other things.  
  
  
  
7\. Access and data integrity  
  
LOVOO endeavors to achieve the greatest possible accuracy of its stored
personal data. For this purpose LOVOO has implemented technologies,
administrative procedures and policies. LOVOO gives individuals, within
reasonable limits, access to personal data that LOVOO has made available to
them and also the opportunity to verify this data and correct it if necessary
or demand the anonymization, blocking or deletion of this data. Furthermore,
to protect your privacy and security we take the appropriate measures to
verify your identity – for example, by entering a password and a user ID –
before we allow you access to your data. In order to view or change personal
data that you have directly provided to LOVOO, you can return to the webpage
where you originally submitted the data and follow the instructions given
there, or, if this function is available.  
  
  
  
8\. Security of your personal data  
  
LOVOO takes extremely seriously the trust that you place in us. LOVOO employs
appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures to protect the
information collected by LOVOO, in order to prevent unauthorized access to
your data or its disclosure, to maintain the integrity of the data and to
ensure its correct usage. When collecting or passing on sensitive data such as
credit card information, SSL encryption (Secure Sockets Layer) can be employed
by the user, which guarantees that no one can view your data except us. This
security measure is activated when you see the symbol of a broken key or a
closed lock (depending on your browser) at the bottom of your browser window.
When accessing the domain in the address line of your browser, use
https://www.lovoo.com instead of http://www.@lovoo.com to activate SSL
encryption.
