    Microsoft collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our products. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create a Microsoft account, submit a search query to Bing, speak a voice command to Cortana, upload a document to OneDrive, purchase an MSDN subscription, sign up for Office 365, or contact us for support. We get some of it by recording how you interact with our products by, for example, using technologies like
    <a class="mscom-link" href="#maincookiessimilartechnologiesmodule">cookies</a>, and receiving error reports or usage data from software running on your device.
</p><p>
    We also obtain data from third parties.  We protect data obtained from third parties according to the practices described in this statement, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data. These third-party sources vary over time, but have included:
</p><ul><li>Data brokers from which we purchase demographic data to supplement the data we collect.</li><li>Social networks when you grant permission to a Microsoft product to access your data on one or more networks.</li><li>Service providers that help us determine a location based on your IP address in order to customize certain products to your location.</li><li>Partners with which we offer co-branded services or engage in joint marketing activities, and</li><li>Publicly-available sources such as open government databases or other data in the public domain.</li></ul><p>You have choices about the data we collect. When you are asked to provide personal data, you may decline. But if you choose not to provide data that is necessary to provide a product or feature, you may not be able to use that product or feature.</p><p>The data we collect depends on the products and features you use, and can include the following:</p><p><strong>Name and contact data</strong>. We collect your first and last name, email address, postal address, phone number, and other similar contact data.
</p><p><strong>Credentials</strong>. We collect passwords, password hints, and similar security information used for authentication and account access.</p><p><strong>Demographic data</strong>. We collect data about you such as your age, gender, country, and preferred language.</p><p><strong>Payment data</strong>. We collect data necessary to process your payment if you make purchases, such as your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number), and the security code associated with your payment instrument.</p><p><strong>Device and Usage data</strong>. We collect data about your device and how you and your device interact with Microsoft and our products. For example, we collect:</p><ul><li><em>Product use data</em>. We collect data about the features you use, the items you purchase, and the web pages you visit. This data includes your voice and text search queries or commands to Bing, Cortana, and our chat bots.</li><li><em>Device, connectivity and configuration data</em>. We collect data about your device and the network you use to connect to our products. It includes data about the operating systems and other software installed on your device, including product keys. It also includes IP address, device identifiers (such as the IMEI number for phones), regional and language settings.</li><li><em>Error reports and performance data</em>. We collect data about the performance of the products and any problems you experience with them. This data helps us to diagnose problems in the products you use, and to improve our products and provide solutions. Depending on your product and settings, error reports can include data such as the type or severity of the problem, details of the software or hardware related to an error, contents of files you were using when an error occurred, and data about other software on your device.</li><li><em>Support Data</em>. When you engage Microsoft for support, we collect data about you and your hardware, software, and other details related to the support incident. Such data includes contact or authentication data, the content of your chats and other communications with Microsoft support, data about the condition of the machine and the application when the fault occurred and during diagnostics, and system and registry data about software installations and hardware configurations.</li></ul><p><strong>Interests and favorites</strong>. We collect data about your interests and favorites, such as the teams you follow in a sports app, the stocks you track in a finance app, or the favorite cities you add to a weather app. In addition to those you explicitly provide, your interests and favorites may also be inferred or derived from other data we collect.</p><p><strong>Contacts and relationships</strong>. We collect data about your contacts and relationships if you use a Microsoft product to manage contacts, or to communicate or interact with other people or organizations.</p><p><strong>Location data</strong>. We collect data about your location, which can be either precise or imprecise. Precise location data can be Global Position System (GPS) data, as well as data identifying nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, we collect when you enable location-based products or features. Imprecise location data includes, for example, a location derived from your IP address or data that indicates where you are located with less precision, such as at a city or postal code level.</p><p><strong>Content</strong>. We collect content of your files and communications when necessary to provide you with the products you use. For example, if you receive an email using Outlook.com or Exchange Online, we need to collect the content of that email to deliver it to your inbox, display it to you, enable you to reply to it, and store it for you until you choose to delete it. Examples of this data include: the content of your documents, photos, music, or videos you upload to a Microsoft service such as OneDrive, as well as the content of your communications sent or received using Microsoft products such Outlook.com or Skype, including the:</p><ul><li>subject line and body of an email,</li><li>text or other content of an instant message,</li><li>audio and video recording of a video message, and</li><li>audio recording and transcript of a voice message you receive or a text message you dictate.</li></ul><p>We also collect the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback and product reviews you write, or questions and information you provide for customer support. When you contact us, such as for customer support, phone conversations or chat sessions with our representatives may be monitored and recorded. If you enter our retail stores or other facilities, your image may be captured by our security cameras.</p><p>Product-specific sections below describe data collection practices applicable to use of those products.</p></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span id="Header">How We Use Personal Data</span><span id="navigationHeader">How We Use Personal Data</span><span id="moduleName">mainhowweusepersonaldatamodule</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span class="Description" id="ShortDescription" aria-expanded="false"><p>Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you the products we offer, which includes using data to improve and personalize your experiences. We also may use the data to communicate with you, for example, informing you about your account, security updates and product information. And we use data to help show more relevant ads, whether in our own products like MSN and Bing, or in products offered by third parties. However, we do not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos or other personal files to target ads to you.</p></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span class="Description" id="LongDescription" aria-expanded="true"><p>
    Microsoft uses the data we collect for three basic purposes, described in more detail below: (1) to operate our business and provide (including improving and personalizing) the products we offer, (2) to send communications, including promotional communications, and (3) for some products, to show advertising.
</p><p>
    In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect to give you a more seamless, consistent and personalized experience. For example,
    <a class="mscom-link" href="#maincortanamodule">Cortana</a> can use the favorite sports teams you add to the Microsoft Sports app to provide information relevant to your interests, or
    <a id="mainwindowsstoremodulefromHowWeUsePersonalData" class="mscom-link" href="#mainwindowsstoremodule">Windows Store</a> can use information about the apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations. However, to enhance privacy, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations. For example, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address or phone number.
</p><p><strong>Providing and improving our products</strong>. We use data to provide and improve the products we offer and perform essential business operations. This includes operating the products, maintaining and improving the performance of the products, including developing new features, research, and providing customer support. Examples of such uses include the following.
</p><ul><li><strong>Providing the Products</strong>. We use data to carry out your transactions with us and to provide our products to you. Often, those products include personalized features and recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment, and automatically tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about your activities, interests and location.
    </li><li><strong>Customer support</strong>. We use data to diagnose product problems, repair customers' devices, and provide other customer care and support services.
    </li><li><strong>Product activation</strong>. We use data - including device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network and subscription identifiers - to activate software and devices that require activation.
    </li><li><strong>Product Improvement</strong>. We use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities, such as using error reports to improve security features, using search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, using usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, or using audio recordings from voice input features to improve speech recognition accuracy.
    </li><li><strong>Security, Safety and Dispute Resolution</strong>. We use data to protect the security and safety of our products and our customers, to detect and prevent fraud, to confirm the validity of software licenses, to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. For example, many of our communications and file syncing products systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing or malware links; and we may block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms.
    </li><li><strong>Business Operations</strong>. We use data to develop aggregate analysis and business intelligence that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions, and report on the performance of our business.
    </li></ul><p><strong>Communications</strong>. We use data we collect to deliver and personalize our communications with you. For example, we may contact you by email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending, let you know when security updates are available, remind you about items left in your online shopping cart, update you or inquire about a service or repair request, invite you to participate in a survey, or tell you that you need to take action to keep your account active. Additionally, you can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. For information about managing email subscriptions and promotional communications, please visit the
    <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainhowtoaccesscontrolyourdatamodule">Access and Controls</a> section of this privacy statement.
</p><p><strong>Advertising</strong>. Many of our products are supported by advertising. We share the data we collect with third parties such as AOL and AppNexus so that they can select and deliver some of the ads you see on our sites and apps, as well as other sites and apps serviced by these partners. The ads that you see may be selected based on your current location, search query, or the content you are viewing. Other ads are targeted based on your likely interests or other information learned about you over time using demographic data, search queries, interests and favorites, usage data from our own sites and apps and the sites and apps of our advertisers and partners, and location data - which we refer to as "interest-based advertising" in this statement. To provide interest-based advertising, we combine cookies placed on your device using information that we collect (such as IP address) when your browser interacts with our websites. If you opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, data associated with these cookies will not be used. Microsoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos or other personal files to target ads to you. <strong>You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft by visiting our <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759">opt-out page</a></strong>. More information about advertising controls is available in the
    <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainhowtoaccesscontrolyourdatamodule">Access and Controls</a> section of this privacy statement. Further details regarding our advertising-related uses of data include:
</p><ul><li><strong>Advertising Industry Best Practices and Commitments</strong>. Microsoft is a member of the
        <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative</a> (NAI) and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct. We also adhere to the following self-regulatory programs:

        <ul><li>
                In the US:

In the United States, we provide interest-based advertising based on a limited number of standard, non-sensitive health-related interest categories, including allergies, arthritis, cholesterol, cold and flu, diabetes, gastrointestinal health, headache / migraine, healthy eating, healthy heart, menâs health, oral health, osteoporosis, skin health, sleep, and vision / eye care. We will also target ads based on custom, non-sensitive health-related interest categories as requested by advertisers.
    </li><li><strong>Children and Advertising</strong>. We do not deliver interest-based advertising to children whose birthdate in their Microsoft account identifies them as under 13 years of age.
    </li><li><strong>Data Retention</strong>. For interest-based advertising, we retain data for no more than 13 months, unless we obtain your consent to retain the data longer.
    </li><li><strong>Data Sharing</strong>. In some cases, we share with advertisers reports about the data we have collected on their sites or ads. Advertisers may choose to place our
        <a class="mscom-link" href="#maincookiessimilartechnologiesmodule">web beacons</a>Â on their sites in order to allow Microsoft to collect information on their sites such as activities, purchases and visits; we use this data on behalf of our advertising customers to help target their ads. We also share data directly with service providers (such as AOL and AppNexus) to permit them to provide services on our behalf or to partner with us in selecting and serving ads for our advertising partners.
    </li><li><strong>Data Collected by Other Advertising Companies</strong>. Advertisers sometimes include their own
        <a class="mscom-link" href="#maincookiessimilartechnologiesmodule">web beacons</a> (or those of their other advertising partners) within their advertisements that we display, enabling them to set and read their own
        <a class="mscom-link" href="#maincookiessimilartechnologiesmodule">cookie</a>. Additionally, Microsoft partners with third-party ad companies to help provide some of our advertising services, and we also allow other third-party ad companies to display advertisements on our sites. These third parties may place cookies on your computer and collect data about your online activities across websites or online services. These companies currently include, but are not limited to:

We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. We also share data with Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect the rights or property of Microsoft.
</p></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span class="Description" id="LongDescription" aria-expanded="true"><p>
    We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. For example, we share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so, such as when you send an email to a friend, share photos and documents on OneDrive, or link accounts with another service. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. 
</p><p>
    In addition, we share personal data among Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data in order to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.
</p><p>
    Finally, we will access, transfer, disclose, and preserve personal data, including your content (such as the content of your emails in Outlook.com, or files in private folders on OneDrive), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to: 
</p><ol><li>comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies; </li><li>protect our customers, for example to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of our products, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone; </li><li>operate and maintain the security of our products, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks; or </li><li>protect the rights or property of Microsoft, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the services - however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of Microsoft, we will not inspect a customer's private content ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement. </li></ol><p>
    For more information about data we disclose in response to requests from law enforcement and other government agencies, please see our Law Enforcement Transparency Report, available at <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/en-us/reporting/transparency">microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/en-us/reporting/transparency</a>.

    You can view, edit, or delete your personal data online for many Microsoft products. You can also make choices about Microsoft's collection and use of your data. How you can access or control your personal data will depend on which products you use. For example:
</p><ul><li><strong>Microsoft privacy dashboard.</strong> You can see and control activity data across multiple Microsoft services on the Microsoft privacy dashboard at:
        <a class="mscom-link" href="https://account.microsoft.com/privacy">account.microsoft.com/privacy</a>. From here, you can view, and clear browsing, search, and location data associated with your Microsoft account. You can also manage data in your Cortana Notebook and Microsoft Health services.
    </li><li><strong>Microsoft account</strong>. If you wish to access, edit, or remove the profile information and payment information in your
        <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainmicrosoftaccountmodule">Microsoft account</a>, change your password, add security information or close your account, you can do so by visiting
        <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://account.microsoft.com">account.microsoft.com</a>. From here, you can also access controls for other Microsoft products.
    </li><li><strong>Skype</strong>. If you wish to access edit or remove profile information and payment information in your Skype account or change your password, you can sign into your account at
        <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://login.skype.com/login">login.skype.com/login</a>.
    </li><li><strong>Xbox</strong>. If you use Xbox Live or Xbox.com, you can view or edit your personal data, including billing and account information, privacy settings, online safety and data sharing preferences by accessing
        <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="http://live.xbox.com/MyXbox/Profile">My Xbox</a> on the Xbox console or on the Xbox.com website.
    </li><li><strong>Microsoft Store</strong>. You can access your Microsoft Store profile and account information by visiting
        <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://www.microsoftstore.com/">www.microsoftstore.com/</a> and clicking on "View account" or "Order history."
    </li><li><strong>Microsoft.com</strong>. You can access and update your profile on microsoft.com by visiting the
        <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=317027">Microsoft.com Profile Center</a>. If you have a Microsoft Developer Network public profile, you can access and edit it at
        <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://connect.microsoft.com/profile.aspx">connect.microsoft.com/profile.aspx</a>.
    </li></ul><p>
    If you cannot access certain personal data collected by Microsoft via the links above or directly through the Microsoft products you use, you can always contact Microsoft by using our
    <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=321116">web form</a>. We will respond to requests to access or delete your personal data within 30 days.
</p><p><strong>Your Communications Preferences</strong></p><p>
    You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that message. You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by signing in with your personal
    <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainmicrosoftaccountmodule">Microsoft account</a>, and viewing your
    <a class="mscom-link" href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=243191">communication permissions</a> where you can update contact information, manage Microsoft-wide contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with Microsoft partners. If you do not have a personal Microsoft account, you can manage your Microsoft email contact preferences by using this
    <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=243189">web form</a>. These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain Microsoft services, or to surveys or other informational communications that have their own unsubscribe method.
</p><p><strong>Your Advertising Choices</strong></p><p>
    You may opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft by visiting our
    <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759">opt-out page</a>. When you opt out, your selection will be stored in a
    <a class="mscom-link" href="#maincookiessimilartechnologiesmodule">cookie</a> that is specific to the web browser you are using. The opt-out cookie has an expiration date of five years. If you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to opt out again.
</p><p>You can also link your opt-out choice with your personal Microsoft account. It will then apply on any device where you useÂ that account, and will continue to apply until someone signs in with a different personal Microsoft account on that device. If you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to sign in again for the settings to apply.</p><p>
    For advertising that appears in apps on Windows, you may use the opt-out linked to your personal Microsoft account, or opt out of interest-based advertising by turning off the
    <a id="mainadvertisingidmodulefromHowtoAccess" class="mscom-link" href="#mainadvertisingidmodule">advertising ID</a> in Windows Settings.
</p><p>
    Because the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other necessary purposes (including providing our products, analytics and fraud detection), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop that data from being collected. Nor does it mean you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads. However, if you do opt out, the ads you receive will no longer be interest-based and may be less relevant to your interests.
</p><p><strong>Browser-Based Controls</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cookie Controls</strong>. Relevant browser-based cookie controls are described in the
        <a class="mscom-link" href="#maincookiessimilartechnologiesmodule">Cookies</a> section of this privacy statement.
    </li><li><strong>Tracking Protection</strong>. Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) has a feature called Tracking Protection that will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a Tracking Protection List you add. By limiting calls to these sites, the browser will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you.
    </li><li><strong>Browser Controls for "Do Not Track."</strong> Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals. In the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described above.

Cookies allow us, among other things, to store your preferences and settings; enable you to sign-in; provide interest-based advertising; combat fraud; and analyze how our websites and online services are performing. Microsoft apps use other identifiers, such as the advertising ID in Windows, for similar purposes. 
</p><p>We also use web beacons to help deliver cookies and gather usage and performance data. Our websites may include web beacons and cookies from third-party service providers. 	
</p><p>You have a variety of tools to control cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, including browser controls to block and delete cookies and controls from some third-party analytics service providers to opt out of data collection through web beacons.

    Microsoft uses cookies (small text files placed on your device) and similar technologies to provide our websites and online services and to help collect data. The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but it can contain other information as well. Microsoft apps use other identifiers, such as the <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainadvertisingidmodule">advertising ID</a> in Windows, for similar purposes, and many of our websites and applications also contain web beacons or other similar technologies, as described below.
</p><p><strong>Our Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong></p><p>Microsoft uses cookies and similar technologies for several purposes, depending on the product, including:</p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><strong>Storing your Preferences and Settings</strong>. Settings that enable our products to operate correctly or that maintain your preferences over time may be stored on your device. For example, if you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft website, we may store that data in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site. If you opt out of interest-based advertising, we store your opt-out preference in a cookie on your device.</li><li><strong>Sign-in and Authentication</strong>. When you sign into a website using your personal <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainmicrosoftaccountmodule">Microsoft account</a>, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your device. This cookie allows you to move from page to page within the site without having to sign in again on each page. </li><li><strong>Interest-Based Advertising</strong>. Microsoft uses cookies to collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that is most relevant to you. You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described in theÂ <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainhowtoaccesscontrolyourdatamodule">Access and Control</a>Â section of this privacy statement. </li><li><strong>Analytics</strong>. In order to provide our products, we use cookies and other identifiers to gather usage and performance data. For example, we use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service and to develop other statistics about the operations of our products. </li></ul><p>
    Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart. This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate the main reasons we typically set cookies. If you visit one of our websites, the site may set some or all of the following cookies:
</p><table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Cookie name</strong><strong></strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>MUID</p></td><td><p>Identifies unique web browsers visiting Microsoft sites. It is used for advertising, site analytics and other operational purposes.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ANON</p></td><td><p>Contains the ANID, a unique identifier derived from your Microsoft account, which is used for advertising, personalization, and operational purposes. It is also used to preserve your choice to opt out of interest-based advertising from Microsoft, if you have chosen to associate the opt-out with your Microsoft account.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>CC</p></td><td><p>Contains a country code as determined from your IP address.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>RPSTAuth, MSNRPSAuth, KievRPSAuth</p></td><td><p>Helps to authenticate you when you sign in with your Microsoft account.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NAP</p></td><td><p>Contains an encrypted version of your country, postal code, age, gender, language and occupation, if known, based on your Microsoft account profile.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>MH</p></td><td><p>Appears on co-branded sites where Microsoft is partnering with an advertiser. This cookie identifies the advertiser so the right ad is selected.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TOptOut</p></td><td><p>Records your decision not to receive interest-based advertising delivered by Microsoft.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>
    In addition to the cookies Microsoft sets when you visit our websites, third parties may also set cookies when you visit Microsoft sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties' web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services.
</p><p><strong>How to Control Cookies</strong></p><p>
    Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but provide controls that allow you to block or delete them. For example, in Microsoft Edge, you can block or delete cookies by clicking <strong>SettingsÂ &gt; PrivacyÂ &gt; Cookies.</strong> Instructions for blocking or deleting cookies in other browsers may be available in each browser's privacy or help documentation.
</p><p>
    Certain features of Microsoft products depend on cookies. Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use those features, and preferences that are dependent on cookies may be lost. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.
</p><p>
    Additional privacy controls that can impact cookies, including the Tracking Protection feature of Microsoft browsers, are described in the
    <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainhowtoaccesscontrolyourdatamodule">Access and Control</a> section of this privacy statement.
</p><p><strong>Our Use of Web Beacons and Analytics Services</strong></p><p>Microsoft web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs) that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites and deliver co-branded products. We also include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them. </p><p>In addition to placing web beacons on our own websites, we sometimes work with other companies to place our web beacons on their websites or in their advertisements. This helps us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft website results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's website. </p><p>
    Finally, Microsoft products often contain web beacons or similar technologies from third-party analytics providers, which help us compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations. These technologies enable the analytics providers to set or read their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information about your online activities across applications, websites or other products. However, we prohibit these analytics providers from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access information that directly identifies you (such as your name or email address). You can opt out of data collection or use by some of these analytics providers by clicking the following links:

    In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, our products can also use other similar technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This is typically done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, these technologies can also be used to store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then be used to track behavior. These technologies include Local Shared Objects (or "Flash cookies") and Silverlight Application Storage.
</p><p><strong>Local Shared Objects or "Flash cookies."</strong> Web sites that use Adobe Flash technologies can use Local Shared Objects or "Flash cookies" to store data on your computer. To manage or block Flash cookies, go to

</p><p><strong>Silverlight Application Storage.</strong> Web sites or applications that use Microsoft Silverlight technology also have the ability to store data by using Silverlight Application Storage. To learn how to manage or block such storage, see the

When you create your own Microsoft account, we refer to that account as a personal Microsoft account. When you sign into products that use Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AAD) with an email address from your employer or school, we refer to that account as a work or school account.</p><p><strong>Creating and using your personal Microsoft account</strong>. When you create a personal Microsoft account, you will be asked for certain personal data and we will assign a unique ID number to identify your account and associated information. While some products, such as those involving payment, require a real name, you can sign into and use some Microsoft products without providing your real name. Some data you provide, such as your display name, email address and phone number, can be used to help others find and connect with you within Microsoft products. For example, people who know your display name, email address or phone number can use it to search for you on Skype and send you an invite to connect with them. Note that if you use a work or school email address to create a personal Microsoft account, and your employer or school that issued that address begins managing that account with Azure Active Directory (AAD), you will need to update the email address associated with your personal Microsoft account in order to continue accessing Microsoft products that do not use AAD (such as Xbox Live).
</p><p><strong>Signing in</strong>. When you sign into your Microsoft account, we create a record of your sign-in, which includes the date and time, information about the product you signed into, your sign-in name, the unique number assigned to your account, a unique identifier assigned to your device, your IP address, and your operating system and browser version.</p><p><strong>Signing into Microsoft</strong>. Signing into your account enables improved personalization, provides seamless and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to access and use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other enhanced features and settings. When you sign into your account, you will stay signed in until you sign out. If you add your Microsoft account to a Windows device (version 8 or higher), Windows will automatically sign you into products that use Microsoft account that you access on that device. When you are signed in, some products will display your name or username and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) as part of your use of Microsoft products, including in your communications, social interactions and public posts.</p><p><strong>Signing into third-party products</strong>. If you sign into a third-party product with your Microsoft account, you will be asked to consent to share the account data required by that product. The third party will also receive the version number assigned to your account (a new version number is assigned each time you change your sign-in data); and whether your account has been deactivated. If you have consented to share your profile data, the third party may display your name or username and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) when you are signed in to that third-party product. If you chose to make payments to third-party merchants using your Microsoft account, Microsoft will pass to the third party information stored in your Microsoft account necessary to process your payment and fulfill your order (such as name, credit card number, billing and shipping addresses, and relevant contact information). The third party can use or share the data it receives when you sign in or make a purchase according to its own practices and policies. <strong>You should carefully review the privacy statement for each product you sign into and each merchant you purchase from to determine how it will use the data it collects.</strong></p><p><strong>Personal Microsoft accounts received from third parties</strong>. If you received your personal Microsoft account from a third party, like an Internet service provider, that third party may have rights over your account, including the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account. <strong>You should carefully review any additional terms the third party provided you to understand what it can do with your account.</strong></p><p><strong>Connecting your personal Microsoft account to your social network accounts</strong>. You may connect your personal Microsoft account to your accounts on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn in order to access data from those social networks from within Microsoft products. If you choose to do so, we will store data about your social network accounts on our servers so that we can display updated data from your social network account. You can disconnect a social network account from your personal Microsoft account at any time at
    <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://profile.live.com/services">profile.live.com/services</a>.
</p><p><strong>Using work or school accounts</strong>. If your employer or school uses Azure Active Directory (AAD) to issue and manage the account it provides you, you can use your work or school account to sign into Microsoft products that use AAD (such as Office 365 or Skype for Business). If required by your organization, you will also be asked to provide a phone number or an alternative email address for additional security verification. If you sign into Microsoft products with a work or school account, the owner of the domain associated with your email address may control and administer your account, and access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files. Your use of the products may be subject to your organization's policies, if any. Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of these organizations, which may differ from those of Microsoft. If your organization is administering your use of Microsoft products, please direct your privacy inquiries to your administrator.

Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary significantly.

In such cases, we maintain the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your Outlook.com inbox to the Deleted Items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion).</li><li><em>Is there an automated control, such as in the Microsoft privacy dashboard, that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time?</em> If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.</li><li><em>Is the personal data of a sensitive type?</em> If so, a shortened retention time would generally be appropriate.</li><li><em>Has Microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type?</em> For example, for Bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers after 18 months.</li><li><em>Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?</em> If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.</li><li><em>Is Microsoft subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain the data?</em> Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data that must be retained for the purposes of litigation.</li></ul></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span id="Header">Collection of Data From Children</span><span id="navigationHeader">Collection of Data From Children</span><span id="moduleName">maincollectionofdatafromchildrenmodule</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span class="Description" id="ShortDescription"><p>When a Microsoft product collects age it will either block users under 13 or will ask them to provide consent from a parent or guardian before they can use it.

</p></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span class="Description" id="LongDescription" aria-expanded="true"><p>
    Bing services include search and mapping services, as well as the Bing Toolbar and Bing Desktop apps. Bing services are also included within other Microsoft services, such as
    <a class="mscom-link" title="MSN" href="#mainmainmodule">MSN</a> Apps and
    <a class="mscom-link" title="Cortana" href="#maincortanamodule">Cortana</a>, and certain features in
    <a class="mscom-link" title="Windows" href="#mainwindowsmodule">Windows</a> (which we refer to as Bing-powered experiences).
</p><p>
    When you conduct a search, or use a feature of a Bing-powered experience that involves conducting a search or entering a command on your behalf, Microsoft will collect the search orÂ commandÂ terms you provide, along with your IP address, location, the unique identifiers contained in our
    <a class="mscom-link" title="Cookies" href="#maincookiessimilartechnologiesmodule">cookies</a>, the time and date of your search, and your browser configuration. If you use Bing voice-enabled services, additionally your voice input and performance data associated with the speech functionality will be sent to Microsoft. When you use Bing-powered experiences, such as Ask Cortana or Bing Lookup, to search a particular word or phrase within a web page or document, that word or phrase is sent to Bing along with some surrounding content in order to provide contextually relevant search results.
</p><p><strong>Search Suggestions</strong>. For the Search Suggestions feature, the characters that you type into a Bing-powered experience to conduct a search will be sent to Microsoft. This allows us to provide you with suggestions as you type your searches. To turn this feature on or off, while using Bing Search, go to
    <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" title="Bing settings" href="https://www.bing.com/account/general">Bing settings</a>.
    Search Suggestions cannot be turned off in Cortana. On Windows, you can always hide Cortana and the search box so as not to use the feature.
</p><p><strong>Bing Experience Improvement Program for Bing Desktop and Bing Toolbar</strong>. If you are using Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar and choose to participate in the Bing Experience Improvement Program, we also collect additional data about how you use these specific Bing apps, such as the addresses of the websites you visit, to help improve search ranking and relevance. To help protect your privacy, we do not use the data collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify or contact you, or target advertising to you. You can turn off the Bing Experience Improvement Program at any time in the Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar settings. Finally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after 18 months. </p><p><strong>Retention and de-identification.</strong> We de-identify stored search queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers after 18 months.</p><p><strong>Personalization through Microsoft account</strong>. Some Bing services provide you with an enhanced experience when you sign in with your personal
    <a class="mscom-link" title="Microsoft account" href="#mainmicrosoftaccountmodule">Microsoft account</a>, for example, syncing your search history across devices. You can use these personalization features to customize your interests, favorites, and settings, and to connect your account with third-party services. Visit the
    <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" title="Bing Settings" href="https://www.bing.com/account/general">Bing Settings</a> page to manage your personalization settings or the Microsoft privacy dashboard.
</p><p><strong>Managing Search History</strong>. Bing's Search History service provides an easy way to revisit the search terms you've entered and results you've clicked when using Bing search through your browser. You may clear your search history on the Microsoft privacy dashboard at
    <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" title="account.microsoft.com" href="https://account.microsoft.com/privacy">account.microsoft.com/privacy</a>. Clearing your history removes it from the Search History service and prevents that history from being displayed on the site, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above.
</p><p><strong>Non-Microsoft services that use Bing.</strong> You may access Bing-powered experiences when using other non-Microsoft services, such as those from Yahoo!. In order to provide these services, Bing receives data from these and other partners that may include date, time, IP address, a unique identifier and other search-related data. This data will be sent to Microsoft in order to provide the search service. Microsoft will use this data as described in this statement or as further limited by our contractual obligations with our partners. You should refer to the privacy policies of the non-Microsoft services for any questions about how they collect and use data.
</p><p><strong>Search query passed in referral URL.</strong> When you click on a search result or advertisement from a Bing search results page and go to the destination website, the destination website will receive the standard data your browser sends to every web site you visit - such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the URL of the site you came from (in this case, the Bing search results page). Because the URL of the Bing search results page contains the text of the search query you entered (which could include names, addresses, or other identifying information), the destination website will be able to determine the search term you entered.
</p><p>
    If your browser is enabled to allow pages to pre-load in the background for faster performance,Â when your browser loads a page in the background, it will have the same effect as if you visited that page, including sending the Bing search results page URL (containing your search query) and downloading any
    <a class="mscom-link" title="Cookies" href="#maincookiessimilartechnologiesmodule">cookies</a> that page sets.
</p><p><strong>Sharing search data for research and development purposes</strong>. We share some de-identified search query data, including voice queries, with selected third parties for research and development purposes. Before we do so, we remove all unique identifiers such as IP addresses and cookie IDs from the data. We also run the data through a process designed to remove certain sensitive data that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers). Additionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for other purposes.

    Cortana is your personal assistant. Depending on the capabilities of your device and the version of Cortana you are using. (e.g., Windows, Xbox, iOS, etc.) Cortana can provide a range of features, some of them personalized. Cortana works best when you sign in and let her use data from your device, your personal Microsoft account or your work or school account, other Microsoft services, and third-party services you choose to connect. On Windows devices, if you choose not to sign into Cortana, you can still chat with Cortana and use Cortana to help you search the web, or for your documents stored in Microsoft services like OneDrive and on your device. See the subsection on
    <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainwindowssearchmodule">Windows Search</a>
    for more information. But if you donât sign in, your experiences will be more limited and will not be personalized. On iOS and Android devices, Cortana works only when you sign-in.
</p><p><strong>Signed out</strong>. When you are not signed in on a Windows device, Cortana will collect data about how you chat with Cortana and use Cortana to search, using either your voice, inking, or typing. This data includes the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Speech Services</strong>. To help Cortana better understand the way you speak and your voice commands, speech data is sent to Microsoft to build speech models and improve speech recognition and user intent understanding. If you choose to sign in, the speech models will become more personalized.</li><li><strong>Queries and search history</strong>. Your Bing search queries and the Search Suggestion feature - even if Cortana does the searching for you - are treated like any other Bing search queries and are used as described in the 
    <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainbingmodule">Bing</a> section.</li><li><strong>Device Data</strong>. Cortana can access data about your device and how you use it. For instance, it can determine if Bluetooth is on, whether your lock screen in on, your alarm settings, and which apps you install and use.</li></ul><p><strong>Signed in</strong>. If you sign in, you enable Cortana to perform additional tasks and to provide personalized experiences and relevant suggestions; and you give Cortana permission to collect or access the following additional types of data, some of which depend on the capabilities of the version of Cortana you are using (e.g., Windows, Android, iOS, etc.) and the app you are using into which Cortana is integrated (e.g. Skype):</p><ul><li><strong>Microsoft account</strong>. Cortana can access the demographic data (such as your age, postal code and gender) you provided when you created your personal <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainmicrosoftaccountmodule">Microsoft account</a>.</li><li><strong>Other Microsoft product usage</strong>. Cortana uses data collected through other Microsoft services to provide personalized suggestions. For example, Cortana uses data collected by the Sports app, so it can automatically display information about the teams you follow. It also learns your favorite places from Microsoft's Maps app, your favorite songs and artists from the music you play in <a class="mscom-link" href="#maingroovemusicmoviestvmodule">Groove Music</a>, and what you view and purchase in the <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainwindowsstoremodule">Windows Store</a> so it can offer better suggestions. Your interests in Cortana's Notebook can be used by other Microsoft services, such as Bing or MSN, to customize your interests, preferences, and favorites in those experiences as well.</li></ul><p><strong>Location</strong>. You can choose whether Cortana accesses your location information in order to give you the most relevant notices and results and to make suggestions that help save you time, such as traffic information and location-based reminders. If you grant permission, Cortana will regularly collect and use your current location, location history, and other location signals (such as locations tagged on photos you upload to OneDrive). Location information collected by Cortana may also be used in de-identified form to improve the Windows Location Services. See more details in the <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainlocationservicesmotionsensingmodule">Location Services</a> subsection.</p><p><strong>Contacts, email, calendar &amp; communications</strong>. You can choose to let Cortana access your device and cloud-based email and other communications, your calendar, and your contacts in order to enable additional features and personalization. If you give permission, Cortana will access additional data including:</p><ul><li><strong>Text messages and email</strong>. Cortana accesses your messages to do a variety of things such as: allowing you to add events to your calendar, apprising you of important messages, and keeping you up to date on events or other things that are important to you, like package or flight tracking. Cortana also uses your messages to help you with planning around your events and offers other helpful suggestions and recommendations.</li><li><strong>Communications History</strong>. Cortana learns who is most important to you from your call, text message, and email history. This data is used to keep track of people most relevant to you and your preferred methods of communication, flag important messages for you (such as missed calls), and improve the performance of Cortana features such as speech recognition.</li><li><strong>Calendar appointments</strong>. Cortana access your calendars in order to provide reminders and information relevant to your appointments.</li></ul><p><strong>Browsing history</strong>. If you allow Cortana to use your browsing history, Microsoft will collect your Microsoft Edge search queries and full browsing history, associated with a user ID. Cortana will use this data to learn about you and provide you with timely and intelligent answers and proactice personalized suggestions, or to complete web tasks for you. Cortana won't collect information about sites you visit in InPrivate tabs.</p><p><strong>Other Connected Services and managing Skills</strong>. You can also give Cortana access to data collected by other Microsoft and third-party services, or share your Cortana information with those services, by giving your permission to enable or connect those services with Cortana. When you enable a Connected Service or third-party Skill, Cortana shares your request with those services or third parties to enable your command; Cortana may also share additional information that you give permission to share (e.g., your location). Below are examples of Connected Services and Skills., New Connected Services and Skills are added regularly.</p><ul><li><strong>Connected Microsoft services</strong>. If you choose to connect Cortana to your <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainxboxmodule">Xbox Live</a> account, Cortana can access your Xbox Live data in order to learn about your gaming activity and provide you with relevant content and suggestions, notify you when your friends are available to play, and help you schedule game sessions. If you choose to connect Cortana to your work or school account, Cortana can access data stored in <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainenterpriseservicesmodule">Office 365</a> to help you stay up to date and get insights about your meetings and relationships. Choosing to sign into LinkedIn within Cortana allows Microsoft to access your LinkedIn data so that Cortana can give you more personalized information and recommendations. Note, Cortana enables LinkedIn to access the name, email address, job title, and company name of people are you are meeting with, in order for Cortana to retrieve relevant information about those contacts.</li><li><strong>Other Connected services and Skills</strong>. Cortana allows you to connect to third-party services to enable her to do more and provide additional personalized experiences based upon data from the third-party service. Not all Skills require your authentication. With your permission, <strong><em>Cortana can also send information about you along with your request to a third-party</em></strong>. For instance, Cortana will send your request, along with your current location and destination, to Uber when you ask Cortana to request a ride. You can manage Cortana's Connected Services and Skills in the Cortana Notebook.</li></ul><p>When you provide Cortana with permission to access your information from a device or service, this information may be used to seamlessly personalize your Cortana experience on any device or service on which you have enabled Cortana. Remember that you can always sign out of Cortana. When you sign out on Windows, Cortana will still be there to help, but your experiences will not be personalized. You can manage what data Cortana uses, and what it knows about you in Cortana Settings, Permissions, and Notebook.

   Microsoft Health services can help you understand and manage your health data. They include HealthVault, HealthVault Insights, Microsoft Band devices, other Microsoft Health applications and related products. The Band helps you keep track of data like heart rate and steps taken. The Band can also use Cortana to take notes and receive notifications from your phone. The Microsoft Health applications send data to Microsoft's servers and allow you to view, manage and control the data. The applications may enable notifications to the Band and other devices. HealthVault services let you gather, edit, add to, and store health data online, along with share your health data with family, caregivers, and health care professionals.
</p><p>
    Microsoft Health services collect and use your data to provide the services, which includes improving and personalizing your experiences. Health data you provide to Microsoft through Microsoft Health services is not combined with data from other Microsoft services, or used for other purposes without your explicit consent. For example, Microsoft does not use your health record data to market or advertise to you without your opt-in consent.

    Microsoft Health services can help you understand and manage your health data. The data collected depends on the services and features you use, and includes the following:
</p><ul><li><strong>Profile Data</strong>. When you create a profile, you will need to provide data, such as height, weight, and age that is used to calculate your activity results. Other profile data comes from your personal <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainmicrosoftaccountmodule">Microsoft account</a>.
    </li><li><strong>Activity and Fitness Data</strong>. Microsoft Health services help you keep track of your activity and fitness by collecting data like your heart rate, steps, calories burned, and sleep. Examples of types of activities you can choose to track are runs, workouts, and sleep.
    </li><li><strong>Usage Data</strong>. To provide you the best service, we collect and automatically upload statistics about the performance and your use of the Microsoft Health services.
    </li><li><strong>Location</strong>. Microsoft Band has built-in Global Positioning System (GPS) capabilities, which let you map your activities like running or biking, without having to carry your phone with you. If you enable GPS for an activity, you can view the activity map in the Microsoft Health applications. Some modes on the Band, such as Golf and Explorer, automatically turn on GPS, and turn it off when you end the mode.Â 
    </li></ul><p>To learn more about the Band's sensors and the data they collect, go <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/support/hardware/sensors">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Access and Control</strong>. You can view and manage your data in Microsoft Health services. For example, you can view and update your profile data, manage connected applications, and view past activities. You can delete specific activity details in the Microsoft Health services. When you delete a specific activity, the event is deleted from the Microsoft Health services; however, other data and the basic sensor data captured by the devices remain in the Microsoft Health services. You can cancel your Microsoft Health services account at any time by contacting Customer Support <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="http://aka.ms/w6r45e">here</a>.
</p><p><strong>Cortana</strong>. The Microsoft Health services allow you to use Cortana. When you use Cortana, data you process in the Microsoft Health services, including health-related data and data processed from third-party services, is shared with Cortana. Cortanaâs capabilities allow you to perform queries and set reminders with your voice, if <a class="mscom-link" href="#maincortanamodule">Cortana</a> is enabled on your device. To learn more about how <a class="mscom-link" href="#maincortanamodule">Cortana</a> manages your data, see the Cortana section of this privacy statement.

    HealthVault is a personal health platform that lets you gather, edit, store, and share health data online. With HealthVault, you can control your own health records. You can also choose to share your health data with family, caregivers, health care professionals, mobile applications, health-related devices, and online tools. For more information about HealthVault, go to <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="http://aka.ms/kr4ndl">here</a>.
</p><p><strong>Signing into HealthVault</strong>. To sign into HealthVault, you can use <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainmicrosoftaccountmodule">Microsoft account</a> or third-party authentication services. If you close your Microsoft account or lose your account credentials, you may not be able to access your data. You can use more than one credential with HealthVault to help ensure continued access. Before using a third-party authentication service with HealthVault, we recommend you review the security and privacy commitments offered by the issuer.
</p><p><strong>HealthVault Account and Health Records</strong>. To create a new HealthVault account, you must provide personal data such as name, date of birth, e-mail address, postal code and country/region. Depending on which features you use, you may be asked for additional information. A HealthVault account allows you to manage one or more health records, such as the ones you create for yourself and your family members. You can add or remove data to a health record you manage at any time.
</p><p>
    In the U.S., HealthVault assigns each health record a unique HealthVault email address. When a message is received at that email address, the message and attachments are automatically added to the HealthVault record, and a notification email is sent to the custodians of that record. The email service in HealthVault uses "Direct," a protocol designed specifically to communicate with health care providers. For that reason, HealthVault email can only be sent and received with providers that use a system that uses the Direct protocol. Custodians can add or disable record email addresses.
</p><p><strong>Sharing Health Data</strong>. A key value of HealthVault is the ability you have to share your health data with people and services that can help you meet your health-related goals. By default, you are the custodian of any records you create. Custodians have the highest level of access to a health record. As a custodian, you can share data in a health record with another person by sending an e-mail invitation through HealthVault. You can specify what type of access they have (including custodian access), how long they have access, and whether they can modify the data in the record. When you grant someone access, that person can grant the same level of access to someone else (for example, someone with view-only access can grant another user view-only access). <strong>Because inappropriate granting of access could allow someone to violate your privacy or even revoke your access to your own records, you should be cautious about granting access to your records.</strong></p><p>
    You can choose to share specific data (or all of the data) in a health record with other services, including participating third-party services you authorize. No service has access to your data through HealthVault unless an authorized user grants it access through HealthVault. HealthVault allows you to control access by accepting or denying requests. For each service granted access, you choose what health information in a specific health record to share and what actions each service may perform on the health information. 
</p><p>
    A service you authorize for a record will get the full name associated with your HealthVault account, the nickname of the authorized record(s), and your relationship to that record. The service will continue to have access through HealthVault until you revoke the permission. Microsoft can revoke a service's access to HealthVault if it does not meet its privacy commitments to Microsoft. However, except for restricting the access they have to your HealthVault data, we do not control or monitor third-party services, and their privacy practices will vary.
</p><p><strong>Reports to U.S. Health Care Providers</strong>. In the United States, we enable participating health care providers to obtain reports about whether the information they send to a record in Microsoft Health services is used. This feature supports the "meaningful use" objective of the HITECH Act, which provides incentives for health care providers to send their patients copies of their medical information electronically. Providers that participate can get reports that include a number the provider uses to identify the patient within its system, and whether the user took one of the "qualifying actions" in HealthVault (but no information about which action). "Qualifying action" currently includes activities such as viewing, downloading, or transmitting health information via email. You can turn off reporting for your records.
</p><p><strong>Access and controls</strong>. You can review, edit or delete your HealthVault account data, or close your HealthVault account at any time. Only custodians can permanently delete an item. When you delete a heath record, it is deleted from all users who had access to it.
</p><p>
    When you close your HealthVault account, we delete all records for which you are the sole custodian. If you share custodian access for a record, you can decide whether to delete the record. Microsoft will wait a limited amount of time before permanently deleting your data in order to help avoid accidental or malicious removal of your health data.
</p><p>
    HealthVault maintains a full history of each access, change or deletion by users and services, which includes the date, action and name of the person or service. Custodians of records can examine the history of those records.
</p><p><strong>Email Communications</strong>. We will use the email address you provide when you create your HealthVault account to send you an email requesting that you validate your email address, to include in sharing invitations you send through HealthVault, and to send you service notifications, such as email notifications that information is available to add to your HealthVault records.
</p><p>
    HealthVault periodically sends newsletters to help keep you informed of the latest improvements. HealthVault will also periodically send you an email summarizing recent account activity. Subject to your contact preferences, we also use your email addresses to send you promotional email. You can unsubscribe from these emails at any time.

</p><p><strong>Office Roaming Service</strong>. The Office Roaming Service helps keep your Office settings up-to-date across your devices running Office. When you sign into Office with your <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainmicrosoftaccountmodule">Microsoft account</a>, the Office Roaming Service is turned on and syncs some of your customized Office settings to Microsoft servers (such as a list of most recently used documents and the last location viewed within a document). When you sign into Office on another device with the same account, the Office Roaming Service downloads your settings from Microsoft servers and applies them to the additional device. The Office Roaming Service also applies some of your customized Office settings when you sign into Office.com. When you sign out of Office, the Office Roaming Service removes your Office settings from your device. Any changes you made to your customized Office settings are sent to Microsoft servers.</p><p><strong>Microsoft Updates</strong>. Office uses the <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainupdateservicemodule">Microsoft Update</a> service to provide you with security and other important updates. See the Update Services section of this privacy statement for more information.</p><p><strong>Online Help, templates, fonts, and other content</strong>. Office uses other Microsoft or third-party services to give you the latest online content when you are connected to the Internet such as Help articles, templates, and fonts. For example, when you use the Help feature in Office applications, Office sends your search query to Office.com to provide you with online Help articles. These features are turned on by default, but you can turn them off using privacy settings. You can access privacy settings in Office 2013 by clicking <strong>File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Privacy Options</strong>.</p><p><strong>Click-to-Run Update Service</strong>. The Click-to-Run Update Service allows you to install certain Microsoft Office products over the Internet, so you can start using them before they are completely downloaded. By default, the Click-to-Run Update Service also automatically detects online updates to Click-to-Run-enabled products on your device and downloads and installs them automatically. The service is turned on by default, but you can turn it off by using privacy settings.
</p><p><strong>Search services</strong>. Office-supported search services such as Insights allow you to request information from Microsoft or third-party services from within an Office application. For example, in Word, you can highlight a word or phrase and retrieve relevant information from Bing search. When you search on a particular word or phrase, Office sends to the service the encrypted text you requested (and when using Insights, in order to provide you with contextually relevant search results, Office will send your requested word or phrase and some surrounding content from your document). In Excel, you can send categories of data to Microsoft in order to receive recommendations for other sets of similar data that might interest you, but the actual content from your workbook isn't sent to Microsoft. In addition, Office will send data about the software you're using and the locale to which your system is set. If required by a third-party content provider, it will also send authorization data indicating you have the right to download the relevant content. Frequently, the information you receive includes a link to additional information from the content provider's website. If you click the link, the content provider may place a <a class="mscom-link" href="#maincookiessimilartechnologiesmodule">cookie</a> on your device to identify you for future transactions.</p><p><strong>Translation service</strong>. Some Office applications allow you to translate some or all of your document by using a bilingual dictionary or a machine translation. If a word or phrase you want to translate isn't in the bilingual dictionary included with your application software, the word or phrase is sent unencrypted to a Microsoft or a third-party translation service. If you choose to translate your entire document, the entire document is sent unencrypted to a Microsoft or a third-party translation service. In addition to the word or phrase you want to translate, Office sends information about the Office software you are using, including the version, operating system, and locale and language to which your system is set. For third-party translation services, Office might also send previously stored authentication information indicating that you previously signed up for access to the website.

                                When you use OneDrive, we collect data about your usage of the service, as well as the content you store in order to provide, improve and protect the services. Examples include, indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken. We also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling youÂ to sync content across devices and roam customized settings.

                                When you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it. For example, if you store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the Internet who can find the folder. If you store content in a private folder, the content will be private.
                            </p><p>
                                When you share content to a social network like Facebook from a phone that you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to that network or a link to that content is posted to that network. Content posted to social networks and hosted on OneDrive is accessible to anyone on that social network. To delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network and from OneDrive.
                            </p><p>
                                When you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends. The link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content. If one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them. To revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign into yourÂ account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels. Revoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link. No one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again.
                            </p><p>
                                Files managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive. OneDrive for BusinessÂ collects and transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and password, which will be transmitted to Microsoft and/or to the provider of your Office 365 service.

                            </p><p><strong>DRM updates.</strong> In some cases, accessing DRM-protected content will require an update to Silverlight or to the DRM components on your device. When you attempt to play content that requires a DRM update, Silverlight will send a request to a Microsoft server containing basic data about your device, including information about the DRM components on your computer such as their revision and security levels, troubleshooting data, and a unique identifier for your device. The Microsoft server uses this identifier to return a unique DRM update for your device, which will then be installed by Silverlight. You can turn off or configure DRM component updates on the <strong>Playback</strong> tab in the Silverlight Configuration tool.

</p></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span class="Description" id="LongDescription" aria-expanded="true"><p>Skype lets you send and receive voice, video and instant message communications. This section applies to the consumer version of Skype; if you are using Skype for Business, see the <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainenterpriseservicesmodule">Enterprise Products</a> section of this privacy statement. Both Microsoft Corporation and Skype Communications S.Ã .r.l. (a wholly-owned Microsoft subsidiary based in Luxembourg) are data controllers for Skype, and references to Microsoft in this section refer to both legal entities.</p><p>As part of providing these features, Microsoft collects usage data about your communications that includes the time and date of the communication and the numbers or usernames that are part of the communication. </p><p><strong>Skype profile</strong>. To enable other people to find you on Skype (or products that interact with Skype, such as Skype for Business), depending on your profile settings, your Skype profile is included in the search directory. Your profile includes your username, avatar, and any other data you choose to add to your profile or display to others.</p><p><strong>Skype Contacts</strong>. If you use a Microsoft service, such as Outlook.com, to manage contacts, Skype will automatically add the people you know to your Skype contact list. With your permission, Skype will also check your device or other address books from time to time to automatically add your friends as Skype contacts. You can block users if you donât want to receive their communications. </p><p><strong>Partner companies</strong>. To make Skype available to more people, we partner with other companies to allow Skype to be offered via those companiesâ services. If you use Skype through a company other than Microsoft, that companyâs privacy policy governs how it handles your data. To comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, or to help our partner company or local operator comply or respond, we may access, transfer, disclose, and preserve your data. That data could include, for example, your private content, such as the content of your instant messages, stored video messages, voicemails, or file transfers. </p><p><strong>Skype Manager</strong>. Skype Manager lets you manage a groupâs (such as your familyâs) Skype usage from one central place. When you set up a group, you will be the Skype Manager Administrator and can see the patterns of usage, including detailed information, like traffic data and details of purchases, of other members of the group who have consented to such access. If you add information like your name, other people in the group will be able to see it. Members of the group can withdraw consent for Skype Manager on their account page at <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://www.skype.com/">www.skype.com</a>. </p><p><strong>Skype marketing affiliate program.</strong> So that more people can learn about Skype, we encourage other companies and organizations to sign up as marketing affiliates to refer people to Skype. When the people they refer do things like buy Skype Credit, we pay them. We partner with another company, Conversant Media, to operate our affiliate network.  Microsoft, our network partner, and the marketing affiliates use cookies and web beacons so we can know which marketing affiliate made a successful referral and earned a payment. Microsoft doesnât control the cookies that the marketing affiliates set. For more information on the privacy practices of our network partner, visit <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="http://www.conversantmedia.com/legal/privacy">www.conversantmedia.com/legal/privacy</a>.</p><p><strong>Push notifications</strong>. To let you know of incoming calls, chats and other messages, Skype apps use the notification service on your device. For many devices, these services are provided by a another company. To tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Skype has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you. The company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy. Microsoft is not responsible for the data collected by company providing the notification service. If you donât want to use the notification services for incoming Skype calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found in the Skype application or your device. </p><p><strong>Skype advertising</strong>. Some Skype software includes interest-based advertising, so that youâre more likely to see ads youâll like. In some versions of the software, you can opt out of interest-based advertising in the privacy options or account settings menu. If you sign in to Skype with a Microsoft account, you can opt out of interest-based advertising at <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://choice.microsoft.com">choice.microsoft.com</a>. If you opt out, youâll still see ads displayed in the Skype software based on your country of residence, language preference, and IP address location, but other data is not used for ad targeting.</p><p><strong>Translation features</strong>. To help you communicate with people in different languages, some Skype apps offer audio and/or text translation features. When you use translation features, your voice and text data are used to provide and improve Microsoft speech recognition and translation services.</p><p><strong>Recording features</strong>. Some versions of Skype have a recording feature that allows you to capture and share audio and/or video clips of your conversation. If you choose to record a session, the recording may include a few seconds of the call held in memory prior to your initiating the recording. The recording will be stored as part of your conversation history and may also be stored locally on your device. <strong><em>You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording any communication. This includes whether you need to get consent from all parties to the communication in advance.</em></strong> Microsoft is not responsible for how you use your recordings or the recording features.</p></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span id="Header">Store</span><span id="navigationHeader">Store</span><span id="moduleName">mainwindowsstoremodule</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span class="Description" id="ShortDescription" aria-expanded="false"><p>The Store is an online service that allows you to browse, download, purchase, rate, and review applications and other digital content. It includes the Windows Store, Xbox Store, and Office Store. </p></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span class="Description" id="LongDescription" aria-expanded="true"><p>The Store is an online service that allows you to browse, download, purchase, rate, and review applications and other digital content. It includes:</p><ul><li>Windows Store for apps and content for Windows devices such as phones, PCs, and tablets,</li><li>Xbox Store for games and other apps for Xbox ONE and Xbox 360 consoles, and</li><li>Office Store for products and apps for Office, SharePoint, Exchange, Access and Project (2013 versions or later).</li></ul><p>We collect data about how you access and use the Store; the products you've viewed, purchased, or installed; the preferences you set for viewing apps in the Store; and any ratings, reviews or problem reports you submit. Your Microsoft account is associated with your ratings and reviews; and if you write a review, the name and picture from your Microsoft account will be published with your review.</p><p><strong>Permission for Store apps</strong>. Many apps you install from the Windows Store are designed to take advantage of specific hardware and software features of your device. An app's use of certain hardware and software features may give the app or its related service access to your data. For example, a photo editing app might access your device's camera to let you take a new photo or access photos or videos stored on your device for editing, and a restaurant guide might use your location to provide nearby recommendations. Information about the features that an app uses is provided on the app's product description page in the Store. Many of the features that Windows Store apps use can be turned on or off through your deviceâs privacy settings. In Windows, in many cases, you can choose which apps can use a particular feature. Go to <strong>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy</strong>. Select the feature (for example, Calendar) and select which app permissions are on or off. The lists of apps in Windows privacy settings that can use hardware and software features will not include "Classic Windows" applications, and these applications are not affected by these settings. 
    </p><p><strong>App updates</strong>. Unless you have turned off automatic app updates in the relevant Store settings, the Store will automatically check for, download, and install app updates to ensure that you have the latest versions. Updated apps might use different Windows hardware and software features from the previous versions, which could give them access to different data on your device. You will be prompted for consent if an updated app accesses certain features, such as location. You can also review the hardware and software features an app uses by viewing its product description page in the Windows Store.</p><p>Each app's use of your data collected through any of these features is subject to the app developer's privacy policies. If an app available through the Windows Store collects and uses any of your personal data, the app developer is required to provide a privacy policy, and a link to the privacy policy is available on the app's product description page in the Store.</p><p><strong>Sideloaded apps and developer mode</strong>. Developer features such as the "developer mode" setting are intended for development use only. If you enable developer features, your device may become unreliable or unusable, and expose you to security risks. Downloading or otherwise acquiring apps from sources other than the Store, also known as "sideloading" apps, may make your device and personal data more vulnerable to attack or unexpected use by apps. Windows policies, notifications, permissions and other features intended to help protect your privacy when apps access your data may not function as described in this statement for sideloaded apps or when developer features are enabled.</p></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span id="Header">SwiftKey</span><span id="navigationHeader">SwiftKey</span><span id="moduleName">mainswiftkeymodule</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span class="Description" id="ShortDescription" aria-expanded="false"><p>SwiftKey Keyboard and related apps and services collect and use data about how you type to learn your writing style and provide personalized autocorrect and predictive text that adapts to you.</p></span><div class="printDetailedContent" style="display: block;">Full text</div><span class="Description" id="LongDescription" aria-expanded="true"><p>SwiftKey Keyboard and related apps and services use data about how you type â including the emoji you use and the words that matter to you â to learn your writing style and provide personalized autocorrect and predictive text that adapts to you.</p><p>When you use our products, we collect data such as device, network, performance, and usage statistics.

If you choose to turn on <strong>Tailored experiences</strong>, this data can also be used to personalize your experiences with Microsoft products. This data is transmitted to Microsoft and stored with one or more unique identifiers that can help us recognize an individual user on an individual device and understand the device's service issues and use patterns. There are two levels of diagnostic and usage data: <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Full</strong>. At the lowest level, <strong>Basic</strong>, we collect only data necessary to keep Windows devices up-to-date and secure. Basic data includes data about the device itself, the proper functioning of Windows and Store updates, and basic error data. We collect the following data at the Basic level:</p><ul><li>
        Device, connectivity and configuration data:
        <ul><li>Data about the device such as the processor type, OEM manufacturer, type of battery and capacity, number and type of cameras, firmware, and memory attributes.</li><li>Network capabilities and connection data such as the deviceâs IP address, mobile network (including IMEI and mobile operator) and whether the device is connected to a free or paid network.</li><li>Data about the operating system and its configuration such as the OS version and build number, region and language settings, diagnostics level, and whether the device is part of the Windows Insider program.</li><li>Data about connected peripherals such as model, manufacturer, drivers, and compatibility data.</li><li>Data about the applications installed on the device such as application name, version, and publisher.</li></ul></li><li>Whether a device is ready for an update and whether there are factors that may impede the ability to receive updates, such as low battery, limited disk space, or connectivity through a paid network.</li><li>Whether updates complete successfully or fail.</li><li>Data about the reliability of the diagnostics collection system itself.</li><li>Basic error reporting, which is health data about the operating system and applications running on your device.

Microsoft operates a location service that helps determine the precise geographic location of a specific Windows device. Depending on the capabilities of the device, location is determined using satellite global positioning service (GPS), detecting nearby cell towers and/or Wi-Fi access points and comparing that information against a database that Microsoft maintains of cell towers and Wi-Fi access points whose location is known, or deriving location from your IP address. When the location service is active on a Windows device, or you have given permission for Microsoft apps to access location information on non-Windows devices, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected. Microsoft may also share this de-identified location data with third parties to provide and improve location and mapping services.</p><p>
    Windows services and features (such as browsers and Cortana), applications running on Windows, and websites opened in Windows browsers can access the Windows location service to determine precise location if you allow them to do so. Some features and apps request precise location permission when you first install Windows, some ask the first time you use the app, and others ask every time you access the location service. For information about certain Windows apps that use the location service, see the
    <a id="mainwindowsappsmodulefromLocationService" class="mscom-link" href="#mainwindowsappsmodule">Windows Apps</a> section below.
</p><p>
    When the location service is accessed, your Windows device will also upload its location to Microsoft, and we will retain only the last known location (each new location replaces the previous one) to improve the efficiency and operation of our services. Data about a Windows device's recent location history is stored on the device, and certain apps and Windows features can access this location history. You can clear your device's location history at any time in the device's Settings menu.
</p><p>
    In Settings, you can also view which applications have access to the location service or your device's location history, turn off or on access to the location service for particular applications, or turn off the location service. You can also set a default location, which will be used when the location service canât detect a more exact location for your device.
</p><p>Note that on mobile devices, your mobile operator will have access to your location even if you turn off the location service. </p><p><strong>General Location</strong>. If you turn on the General Location feature, apps that cannot use your precise location will have access to your general location, such as your city, postal code, or region.</p><p><strong>Find My Phone</strong>. The Find My Phone feature allows you to find the location of your Windows phone from <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://account.microsoft.com/">account.microsoft.com</a>, even if you have turned off all access to the location service on the phone. If you have turned on the "save my location every few hours" feature in the Find My Phone settings on your phone, the Find My Phone feature will periodically send and store a single last known location of your phone, even if you have turned off location services on your phone. Each time a new location is sent, it replaces the previously-stored location.
</p><p><strong>Find My Device</strong>. The Find My Device feature allowsÂ an administrator of a Windows PC or tablet to find the location of that device if the administrator has enabled the location service for the device, even if other users have disabled location for themselves. When the administrator attempts to locate the device, users will see a notification in the notification center.
</p><p><strong>Windows Motion Sensing</strong>. Windows devices with motion activity detection can collect motion activity. This data can enable features such as a pedometer to count the number of steps you take, so a fitness application can estimate how many calories you burn. This data and history is stored on your device and can be accessed by applications you give permission to access and use that data.
</p><p><strong>Recording</strong>. Some Windows devices have a recording feature that allows you to capture audio and video clips of your activity on the device, including your communications with others. If you choose to record a session, the recording will be saved locally on your device. In some cases, you may have the option to transmit the recording to a Microsoft product or service that broadcasts the recording publicly. <strong>IMPORTANT: You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording and/or transmitting any communication. This includes whether you need to get consent from all parties to the communication in advance.</strong> Microsoft is not responsible for how you use recording features or your recordings.Â

Device encryption helps protect the data stored on your device by encrypting it using BitLocker Drive Encryption technology. When device encryption is on, Windows automatically encrypts the drive Windows is installed on and generates a recovery key. The BitLocker recovery key for your personal device is automatically backed up online in your personal Microsoft OneDrive account. Microsoft doesn't use your individual recovery keys for any purpose.Â 
</p><p><strong>Malicious Software Removal Tool</strong>. The Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) runs on your device at least once per month as part of Windows Update. MSRT checks devices for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software ("malware") and helps remove any infections found. When the MSRT runs, it will remove the malware listed on the Microsoft Support website if the malware is on your device. During a malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific data about malware detected, errors, and other data about your device. If you do not want MSRT to send this data to Microsoft, you can disable MSRT's reporting component.
</p><p><strong>Microsoft Family</strong>. Parents can use Microsoft Family to understand and set boundaries on how their child is using their device. There are many features available to Family members, so please carefully review the information provided when you create or join a Family. When Family activity reporting is turned on for a child, Microsoft will collect details about how the child uses their device and provide parents with reports of that child's activities. Activity reports are routinely deleted from Microsoft servers after a short period of time.
</p><p><strong>SmartScreen</strong>. SmartScreen helps protect you when using our services by checking downloaded files and web content for malicious software, potentially unsafe web content, and other threats to you or your device. When checking a file, data about that file is sent to Microsoft, including the file name, a hash of the file's contents, the download location, and the file's digital certificates. If SmartScreen identifies the file as unknown or potentially unsafe, you will see a warning prior to opening the file. When checking web content, data about the content and your device is sent to Microsoft, including the full web address of the content. If SmartScreen detects that content is potentially unsafe, you will see a warning in place of the content. SmartScreen can be turned on or off in Settings. 
</p><p><strong>Windows Defender</strong>. Windows Defender looks for malware and other unwanted software on your device. Windows Defender is automatically turned on to help protect your device if no other antimalware software is actively protecting your device. If Windows Defender is turned on, it will monitor the security status of your device. When Windows Defender is turned on, or is running because Limited Periodic Scanning is enabled, it will automatically send reports to Microsoft that contain data about suspected malware and other unwanted software, and it may also send files that could contain malware. If a report is likely to contain personal data, the report is not sent automatically, and you'll be prompted before it is sent. You can configure Windows Defender not to send reports and suspected malware to Microsoft.

When you use cloud-based speech recognition, Microsoft collects and uses your voice input to provide you with speech recognition services in Cortana and other supported applications.
    </p><p>
    Additionally, your typed and handwritten words are collected to provide you a personalized user dictionary, help you type and write on your device with better character recognition, and provide you with text suggestions as you type or write. Typing data includes a sample of characters and words you type, which we scrub to remove IDs, IP addresses, and other potential identifiers. It also includes associated performance data, such as changes you manually make to text, as well as words you've added to the dictionary.
</p><p>
    As part of the cloud-based speech recognition service, we also collect information from the user dictionary created on your device. Both the voice data and the user dictionary are collected and used in the aggregate to help improve our ability to correctly recognize all usersâ speech.
</p><p>
    If youâve given permission in Cortana, we also collect your name and nickname, your recent calendar events and the names of the people in your appointments, information about your contacts including names and nicknames, names of your favorite places, apps you use, and information about your music preferences. This additional data enables us to better recognize people, events, places, and music when you dictate commands, messages, or documents.

</p><p>Some of the settings that are synced include:</p><ul><li>Apps you've installed from the Windows Store </li><li>Language preferences </li><li>Ease of Access preferences </li><li>Personalization settings such as your account picture, background, and mouse settings </li><li>Settings for Windows Store apps </li><li>Spell checker dictionaries, input method editor (IME) dictionaries, and personal dictionaries </li><li>Internet Explorer browser history, favorites, and websites you have open  </li><li>Saved app, website, mobile hotspot, and Wi-Fi network names and passwords </li></ul><p>
    You can choose whether to sync your settings, and control what is synced, by going to Sync Settings in the Accounts section of Windows Settings. Some apps have their own, separate sync controls. If you sign into Windows with a work account and you choose to connect that account to your personal Microsoft account, Windows will ask which settings you want to sync before connecting your Microsoft account.

    Update Services for Windows includes Windows Update and Microsoft Update. Windows Update is a service that provides you with software updates for Windows software and other supporting software, such as drivers and firmware supplied by device manufacturers. Microsoft Update is a service that provides you with software updates for other Microsoft software such asÂ <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainofficemodule">Office</a>.
</p><p>
    Windows Update automatically downloads Windows software updates to your device. You can configure Windows Update to automatically install these updates as they become available (recommended) or have Windows notify you when a restart is required to finish installing updates. Apps available through the Windows Store are automatically updated through the Store, as described in theÂ <a id="mainwindowsstoremodulefromUpdateServices" class="mscom-link" href="#mainwindowsstoremodule">Store</a> section above.

Internet Explorer, Microsoft's legacy browser, is also available in Windows. Whenever you use a web browser to access the Internet, data about your device ("standard device data") is sent to the websites you visit and online services you use. Standard device data includes your device's IP address, browser type and language, access times, and referring website addresses. This data might be logged on those websites' web servers. Which data is logged and how that data is used depends on the privacy practices of the websites you visit and web services you use. </p><p>Additionally, data about how you use your browser, such as your browsing history, web form data, temporary Internet files, and <a class="mscom-link" href="#maincookiessimilartechnologiesmodule">cookies</a>, is stored on your device. You can delete this data from your device using Delete Browsing History. </p><p>New features in Microsoft Edge allow you to capture and save content on your device, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Web Note</strong>: which allows you to create ink and text annotations on the web pages you visit, and clip, save or share them; </li><li><strong>Active Reading</strong>: which allows you to create and manage reading lists including websites or documents; and </li><li><strong>Hub</strong>: which allows you to easily manage your reading lists, favorites, downloads, and history all in one area. </li></ul><p>
    Some Microsoft browser information saved on your device will be synced across other devices when you sign in with your Microsoft account. For instance, in Internet Explorer, this information includes your browsing history and favorites; and in Microsoft Edge, it includes your favorites and reading lists. As an example, if you sync your Microsoft Edge reading list across devices, copies of the content you choose to save to your reading list will be sent to each synced device for later viewing. You can disable syncing in Internet Explorer by going to Sync Settings in the Accounts section of Windows Settings (see
    <a id="mainsyncsettingsmodulefromWeb" class="mscom-link" href="#mainsyncsettingsmodule">Sync Settings</a>). You can also disable syncing of Microsoft Edge browser information by turning off the sync option in Microsoft Edge Settings.
</p><p>Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer use your search queries and browsing history to provide you with faster browsing and more relevant search results. These features include:</p><ul><li><strong>AutoSearch and Search Suggestions</strong> in Internet Explorer automatically sends the information you type into the browser address bar to your default search provider (such as Bing) and offer search recommendations as you type each character. In Microsoft Edge, this feature automatically sends this information to Bing even if you have selected another default search provider.
    </li><li><strong>Suggested Sites</strong> recommends web contents that you might be interested in based on your search and browsing history.Â 
    </li></ul><p>Browsing data collected in connection with these features is used in the aggregate and you can turn off any of these features at any time. These features will not collect browsing history while you have InPrivate Browsing enabled.</p><p>
    In order to provide search results, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer send your search queries, standard device information, and location (if you have location enabled) to your default search provider. If Bing is your default search provider, we use this data as described in theÂ <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainbingmodule">Bing</a> section of this privacy statement.
</p><p>
    Cortana can assist you with your web browsing in Microsoft Edge with features such as Ask Cortana. You can disable Cortana assistance in Microsoft Edge at any time in Microsoft Edge Settings.

Some of those apps include:</p><p><strong>Maps app.</strong> The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. Please see the
    <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainbingmodule">Bing</a>Â section of this privacy statement to learn more about these Bing-powered experiences. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft's services. You can disable the Maps app's access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app's access to the location service.
</p><p>
    You can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you're signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services (for example, Cortana). See <a id="mainsyncsettingsmodulefromWindowsApp" class="mscom-link" href="#mainsyncsettingsmodule">Sync Settings</a>Â above for more information.
</p><p><strong>Camera and Photo apps.</strong> If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. You can disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.
</p><p>
    Your photos, videos, as well as screenshots, saved in your camera roll automatically upload to OneDrive. You can manage your photos and/or videos in OneDrive, and you can disable the automatic upload in Settings.
</p><p>
    When you take photos embedded with your location, the Photos app can group your photos by time and location. To group your photos, the Photos app sends location data in your photos to Microsoft to determine the names of locations, such as "Seattle, Washington". When you are using the Photo app while signed into your Microsoft account, your photos and videos from OneDrive will be automatically sorted in into albums in the Photo app, and will also appear on the Photo app's live tile. Your photos and/or videos will only be shared with others if you choose to do so.
</p><p><strong>People app.</strong> The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add your Microsoft account to a Windows device, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.
</p><p><strong>Mail and Calendar app.</strong> The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the appâs use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoftâs servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data thatâs synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the Internet to the third-party provider's server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app. </p><p><strong>Messaging app.</strong> When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your Microsoft account. To delete such messages from storage, you must delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message. Location information will be collected by Microsoft as described in the Windows <a id="mainsyncsettingsmodulefromWindowsApp" class="mscom-link" href="#mainlocationservicesmotionsensingmodule">Location Services</a> section.
</p><p><strong>Microsoft Wallet App for Windows Phone.</strong> You can use Microsoft Wallet to hold information such as coupons, loyalty cards, tickets, and other digital content. Where available, you can also add payment cards to the Microsoft Wallet to make payments at participating stores using NFC (near-field communication).</p><p>You can set up your wallet for payment by logging into Microsoft Wallet with your personal Microsoft account and adding payment cards associated with your Microsoft account. When you add a payment card to Microsoft Wallet, we provide data to your bank and payment card network, including your name, card number, billing address, email address, device data (including the device name, type, and identifier), and your location at the time you add your payment card to your wallet. This data is sent to your bank and payment card network to determine the eligibility of your payment card, enable transactions, detect fraud.</p><p>When you make an NFC payment, Microsoft Wallet will provide the merchant with an encrypted version of your payment card (a "token"). The merchant will present this token, along with transaction details, to your bank to complete the transaction and request payment for your transaction.</p></span></div><div class="divModuleDescription"><span id="Header">Windows Hello</span><span id="navigationHeader">Windows Hello</span><span id="moduleName">mainwindowshellomodule</span><div class="printsummary" style="display: block;">Summary</div><span class="Description" id="ShortDescription"><p>

    Xbox consoles are hardware devices that you can use to access and play games, movies, music, and other forms of digital entertainment. Xbox Live (including Games for Windows Live) is Microsoft's online gaming and entertainment service and social network. It provides ways for you to connect with your friends on Xbox Live and other gaming and social networks. Xbox services can be accessed from a variety of devices, including Xbox consoles, PCs (including via xbox.com and the Xbox app), and mobile devices.
</p><p>We collect data about your use of Xbox services, such as:</p><ul><li>When you sign in and sign out, the games you play, your game and score statistics, and the purchases you make and content you obtain. </li><li>Performance data about the Xbox services, your device and your network connection, including any hardware or software errors that occur. </li><li>If you use the Xbox console with Kinect, data about how you use Kinect. See below for more information about Kinect data collection. </li></ul><p>
    All such data is stored with the Xbox console's unique identifier and associated with your personal data. When your Xbox is connected to the Internet, we identify which console and which version of the Xbox operating system you are currently using.
</p><p>
    With your consent, we will collect information about videos you purchase or view through third-party apps on your Xbox console. If you use the Xbox TV app, we collect TV viewing history from your console in a way that doesn't identify you or others.
</p><p>
    If you use an Xbox console that includes a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), and if you play offline or have never signed into the services on the console, usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time you sign into the services.
</p><p><strong>Xbox Live data viewable by other users. </strong>Your gamertag (Xbox live nickname), game and score statistics, achievements, presence (whether you're signed into Xbox Live), and other data about your activity on Xbox Live can be seen by other users on Xbox Live or other properties associated with Xbox Live (including those of partner companies). For example, your gamertag and scores that show on game leaderboards are considered public and can't be hidden. For other types of data, you can adjust your privacy settings on the console or at
    <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://www.xbox.com/">xbox.com</a> to limit or block the sharing with other users.
</p><p><strong>Xbox Live data shared with game or app publishers. </strong>When you use an Xbox Live-enabled game or app, the publisher or service provider for that game or app has access to data about your usage of Xbox Live and that game or app, and may disclose or display (such as on leaderboards) such data. This data includes, for example, your game scores, data about your game play sessions (for example, types of vehicles used in the game), your presence on Xbox Live, the time you spend playing the game or app, rankings, statistics, gamer profiles, avatars, and other content that you may create or submit within the game or app.
</p><p><strong>Linking your Xbox Live account to non-Microsoft accounts.</strong> Some of the games or apps found on Xbox Live are delivered by partner companies, which may require that you create a non-Microsoft account and sign-in credentials to use that game or app. If you choose to link your Microsoft account with your account with a partner company, Microsoft will share limited account information with that company. Such account information can include name, address, email and date of birth but will not include any credit card or other payment information. For games that enable in-game communications, the game publisher will also have access to the content of in-game communications when you are signed into your account with the publisher.
</p><p><strong>Kinect.</strong> The Kinect sensor is a combination of camera, microphone, and infrared sensor that can enable motions and voice to be used to control gameplay and to navigate through the service. For example:
</p><ul><li>If you choose, the camera can be used to sign you into the service automatically using facial recognition. To do this it takes an image of your face and measures distances between key points to create and store a numeric value that represents only you. This data stays on the console and is not shared with anyone, and you can choose to delete this data from your console at any time.</li><li>For gameplay, Kinect will map distances between your body's joints to create a stick figure representation of you that helps Kinect enable gameplay. If you are playing online, we collect those numeric values to enable and improve gameplay and the gaming experience. Kinect also detects specific hand gestures intended to do simple system interactions (such as menu navigation, pan/zoom and scroll). </li><li>For some fitness games, Xbox can use the Kinect sensor to estimate your exercise data, including estimates such as your heart rate during a certain activity or the number of calories burned during a workout. </li><li>Kinect's microphones enable voice chat between players during gameplay. They also enable voice commands for control of the console, game or app,Â or to enter search terms. See below for additional details on voice data collection. </li><li>The Kinect sensor can also be used for audio and video communications through services such as
        <a class="mscom-link" href="#mainskypemodule">Skype</a>. </li></ul><p>

</p><p><strong>Captioning.</strong> During Xbox real-time chat, players may activate a voice-to-text feature, which allows the user to view the audio in-game chat as text. If a user activates this feature, the other players will have no additional notice. Microsoft uses this data to provide captioning of chat for users who need it. We also use this data to improve our ability to provide the service and other, similar voice-based services.</p><p><strong>CommunicationsÂ monitoring.</strong> Xbox Live includes communications features such as text-based messaging and online voice chat between players during gameplay. In order to help provide a safe gaming environment and enforce the
    <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://www.xbox.com/legal/codeofconduct">Microsoft Code of Conduct</a>, we will collect, review, and monitor a sample of these communications, including Xbox Live game chats and party chat communications in live-hosted multiplayer gameplay sessions offered through the services.
</p><p><strong>Voice data for service improvement. </strong>We collect, and use for service improvement, voice search requests or samples of voice commandsÂ occurring while using Kinect.Â These data are stored separately from your Xbox profile.
</p><p><strong>GameDVR.</strong> Any player in a multiplayer game session can use GameDVR to record their view of the gameplay taking place in that session. The recording can capture your in-game character and gamertag in the game clips created by other players in the gameplay session. Note that if a player uses GameDVR on a PC, audio chat may also be captured in a game clip. Microsoft can review game clips for violations of the
    <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://www.xbox.com/legal/codeofconduct">Microsoft Code of Conduct</a>, even if your game clip sharing setting is set to Block.
</p><p><strong>Xbox Live Rewards.</strong> Xbox Live Rewards, available at
    <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" title="rewards.xbox.com" href="https://rewards.xbox.com/">rewards.xbox.com</a>, is a program you can join to receive Xbox credits for being active on the services.
