TRUSTe powers trust by ensuring businesses adhere to privacy best practices
regarding the collection and use of personal information on their websites and
apps. If you see the TRUSTe Certified Privacy Seal on a website or app, the
company operating that property has met the comprehensive privacy
certification requirements established by TRUSTe. The certification process
helps ensure the business is transparent about what information they collect
and how they use the information; the business provides you with control over
what information they collect and how they use that information; and the
business is accountable to the practices they outline in their privacy policy
statement.
