Badoo's Privacy Policy
======================

This policy and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with English law. In the event there is a discrepancy between this English language version and any translated copies of the Privacy Policy, the English version shall prevail.

What’s this all about then?
---------------------------

Hello (again, if you clicked through to here from our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://badoo.com/en/terms/)). You should read this privacy policy because it will tell you exactly how your personal data is being looked after by Badoo and that’s a pretty important thing for you to know. Here are the topics that we cover:

1.  What information we collect and how we collect it
2.  How we use the information and who we share it with
3.  How you can access and update such information
4.  How we protect the information we store about you

Who we are
----------

Badoo is operated by Badoo Trading Limited, a company registered in England at 13 Hawley Crescent, London, NW1 8NP, United Kingdom and company number 754025.

The full legal bit
------------------

We know that other people’s use of your personal data is a big concern for social network users, so we at Badoo have developed this privacy policy (the “**Policy**”) to let you know how we use personal information (‘personal data’ or ‘personal information’).

Our Policy applies to your use of the Badoo website at www.badoo.com (“**Badoo**” or the “**site**” which includes the mobile apps). We suggest you read it in conjunction with our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://badoo.com/en/terms/) (the “**Terms**”). When you access or use Badoo, you agree to our Privacy Policy and you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as we’ve set out in this Policy.

Badoo reserves the right to change our Policy at any time and without notice, so be sure to check this Policy regularly to understand how we use your information.

IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND AGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY THEN YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE.

1. Badoo users and visitors to our site
---------------------------------------

### What information does Badoo collect if I decide to join the Badoo social community?

Badoo is a meeting place for adults, and we provide that service by operating a social network site offering users the opportunity to connect to our global community of users.

To join the Badoo network you will have to complete our online registration form, where we ask you to provide us with information about you such as your name, your email address, your gender, your date of birth, your location details. You also have the opportunity to provide other details about yourself, but these are optional. Because you control your user profile, these details are available to you at any time by accessing your “Profile” page, which gives you the chance to correct or update (other than gender and email address) your information at any time by just logging in to Badoo.

Once you have created a Profile, we will automatically track certain information such as your IP and email addresses. We may from time to time allow our employees to use the product for testing and user engagement purposes.

For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user experience, we require users to verify their accounts (because we want to make sure you are not a robot!) and might ask for your phone number. Don’t worry! This is only to make sure you are real and breathing! We won't use your phone number for marketing purposes.

### What information does Badoo collect about me if I’m under 18?

You can only become a member of Badoo if your aged 18 or over or the age of majority in the country in which you reside if that happens to be greater than 18. That means Badoo does not knowingly collect any information about children, minors or anyone under the age of majority. Nor do we knowingly market to children, minors or anyone under the age of 18. If you are less than 18 years old, we request that you do not submit information to us. If we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal information, we will take steps to terminate that person’s registration and delete their Profile information from Badoo. If we do delete a Profile because you violated our no children rules, we may retain your email and IP address to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new Profile.

### Does Badoo collect my personal information if I am not a member and just visit the site?

No. We don’t collect any personal information about visitors to our site. If you do visit us without becoming a member, we will place session ID cookies on your computer. For more information about cookies generally, look at the answer to “*How does Badoo collect information about me?*” below.

### If I put other information about me on the site, what does Badoo do with it?

Badoo is designed to make it easy for you to find, connect and interact with other members of Badoo by posting information about yourself. When using the App you should assume that anything you post or submit will be publicly viewable and accessible, both by Users of the App and non-Users of the App. For example, to make it easier to find other Badooers and connect with them, we have allowed you to share other users' profiles on Facebook. This feature can be turned off in your settings at any time. You can also use our electronic messaging system, which allows you to communicate with other users. We recommend and encourage you (and all our members) to think carefully about the information they disclose about themselves, and suggest you follow our [Guidelines and Safety Tips](https://badoo.com/en/guidelines/). We also do not recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses, credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers’ licence details and other sensitive information in your Profile which is open to abuse and misuse.

Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on you Profile such as your religious denomination and health details. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your Profile, including your sexual preferences and ethnic background, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs or any video clips that you post on Badoo may reveal these kinds of sensitive personal data. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself, you are explicitly consenting to our processing your information and making this public to other users.

When you post information about yourself or use the messaging, the amount of personal information you share is at your own risk. If you post anything that is inconsistent with our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://badoo.com/en/terms/), we reserve the right to terminate your account.

### What does Badoo collect about me if I use the mobile app?

Badoo offers you the opportunity to stay in touch with the friends and contacts you’ve made no matter where you are. You can do this by using your mobile phone or by downloading an application to your desktop that allows you to share your location with other users.

When you use your mobile or the desktop application, we will collect information about WiFi access points as well as other location information about your longitude and latitude. That information helps us identify your physical location so that it can be displayed and shared with other members choosing to view “nearby” posts.

We use third parties such as Foursquare to provide data on which the location information on Badoo is based. When doing so, we receive and use data of Foursquare's users, and we share data with Foursquare for use by Foursquare for its own purposes. For more information on how Foursquare treat data, please see <https://foursquare.com/legal/privacy/>

If you do not want your location to be known, then please do not download the desktop application or use your mobile device when you are on Badoo. If you have enabled location services, but wish to turn it off, you can do so by the following methods:

1.  Desktop — quit application
2.  Iphone app — settings, location services, off
3.  Android — profile, privacy, on

### What’s collected from me if I use Badoo’s premium services?

When you take advantage of Badoo’s premium features, we collect financial information necessary to process your payments as per your chosen payment method. Please note that we do not store any credit card or other payment card details. However, our payment service providers do (and are approved to do so by all applicable regulatory bodies).

When you access Badoo or play our games we collect certain technical information about your computer system or mobile device and statistical data about how you play our games. We use this information to improve our site and our games, so that you can increase your fun.

### Can Badoo collect information about me from other sites I use, such as Facebook?

If you have registered on one of our partner websites, such as Facebook, your Profile will be available to all users of the Badoo social network whether via our site or our partners’ websites.

Remember that when you register with a Badoo partner, you are also giving them personal information, so we recommend that you read their privacy policies as Badoo does not control how they use their information.

If you have have registered on one of our partner websites, such as Facebook, or you have verified your account via a partner website, we may connect your Badoo profile with your profile on such partner website. We may do this by way of new products and applications which we introduce from time to time, including new products powered by our group companies.

If you have verified your account through a partner website and do not want to link your Badoo profile to your profile on the partner website, please go to the “Verifications” section on your profile page and click “forget this account”.

If you have created a Badoo profile through a partner website and you do not want to link your Badoo profile to your profile on the partner website, Badoo cannot amend these settings. Please visit the application settings on your partner website profile and follow the instructions to remove the Badoo access permissions.

### Does Badoo collect any other personal information about me?

If you contact our Customer Support team via [Feedback page](https://badoo.com/en/feedback/), we will receive your email address, and may track your IP address as well as the information you send to us to help resolve your query. We will keep records of our communications with you, including any complaints that we receive from you about other users (and from other users about you).

### Will Badoo contact me?

On your “Settings” page Badoo offers you the opportunity to receive emails from us about new message notifications or other purposes related to the use of the website.

### Does Badoo use my personal information for any other purpose?

We may use material that you post on the open access areas of Badoo in advertising and promotional materials on our partner sites and partner products. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor your online experience to meet your needs.

We use your personal information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://badoo.com/en/terms/).

2. Friends and other Badoo users
--------------------------------

### When I put information about myself on Badoo, what do the other users see?

To ensure you get to meet as many people as possible on Badoo, other members get to see your user name and any information you post on your Profile, including photos if you select the 'Any users' access setting. Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want other Badoo members to know about you. You can also choose to limit the information that other users see by adjusting your privacy settings in the “Settings” page.

### What am I allowed to do with other user’s personal information?

Use it to meet new friends and make new contacts! Beware that you may not use other users' information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats. Badoo reserves the right to terminate the accounts of those who misuse other users' information or who otherwise violate the [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://badoo.com/en/terms/).

### What information does Badoo collect about my friends and contacts?

You can choose to invite your friends to join Badoo to make sure that they also get the benefits of meeting new people. To make it easier to search and find friends and acquaintances on Badoo, users may search for other members by email address. If you want to invite your friends and contacts to Badoo, we will send an email invitation from Badoo in your name or you can send an SMS (if you use our Android or iPhone app) to your friends and contacts encouraging them to sign up to Badoo. If any of the individuals you have invited do not register within a few days, Badoo may occasionally send reminder emails on your behalf to those individuals. You can choose to invite all your friends or only a select few by simply unticking the names of those friends you do not wish to invite, but please remember you must not invite any children to join. You are responsible for ensuring that your friend has agreed to receiving a Badoo invite.

When you import your contacts, we store their name and email address or their mobile number so that we can automatically connect you and your friend. Badoo does not sell these email addresses or mobile numbers or use them to send any other communication besides email invitations. The friend may contact Badoo to request the removal of their information from our database by visiting Feedback page. Any such request will only apply to addresses or mobile numbers we have at the time of the request and not to any addresses that the member/user provides to us later.

3. Third parties
----------------

### Does Badoo sell my information to other parties?

Not at all. We do not sell or rent out any personal information about you to any third party. Badoo discloses aggregated non-personal data for marketing and promotional purposes. That means we do not disclose any information that could be used to identify you.

### Does Badoo disclose my information to other parties?

We may share aggregated information with such parties as Foursquare that includes your personal information (but which doesn’t identify you directly), together with other information including log data with third parties for industry analysis and demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services.

In particular, in relation to targeted advertising, we use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit [this page](http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

If you choose to, we may share your information with vendors, service providers, and other carefully selected third parties to improve our services to you, such as by facilitating payments. We ensure these parties must adhere to strict data protection and confidentiality provisions that are consistent with this Privacy Policy.

In the event that Badoo or any of its affiliates undergoes a business transition or change of ownership, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, re- organisation, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, or in the event of insolvency or administration, we may be required to disclose your personal information.

Badoo also wishes to maintain a healthy community, and we will cooperate with all third parties to enforce their intellectual property or other rights. We will also cooperate with law enforcement enquiries from within or outside your country of residence. This may include disclosing your personal information to government or law enforcement agencies, or private parties, when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is required by law or when we, in our discretion, believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our legal rights, or those of third parties and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.

4. Data storage
---------------

### Where is my personal information kept?

Badoo is a global website operating through servers located in a number of countries around the world, including the United States. If you live in a country with data protection laws, the storage of your personal data may not provide you with the same protections as you enjoy in your country of residence. By submitting your personal information, or by choosing to upgrade the services you use, or by making use of the applications available on Badoo, you agree to the transfer of your personal information to, and storage and processing of your personal information in, any such countries and destinations.

5. Security
-----------

### How does Badoo protect my personal information?

Badoo has implemented reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect and prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, including your personal information. Badoo uses reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information such as secured servers using firewalls. Our technical experts at Badoo work hard to ensure your secure use of our site.

While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our website, member database and records no website or Internet transmission is completely secure and we cannot guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your password) and to log out of your account after use.

We cannot guarantee the security of your personal data while it is being transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information we have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorised access.

### How do I help keep my information secure?

You may not disclose your password to any third parties or share it with any third parties. If you lose your password or give it out, your personal information may be compromised. If that happens, please report it to Support via [Feedback page](https://badoo.com/en/feedback/). You must change your password immediately via your “Settings” page. Badoo cannot be held responsible for your failure to keep your password secure and failure to do so may violate our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://badoo.com/en/terms/).

6. Your rights
--------------

### How do I change my Profile?

You can review and revise your profile information at any time. Once you register, you will be able to review and change much of your personal information including:

1.  Your contact email address;
2.  Your profile, photographs, and videos;
3.  Your city, region, and country of residence;
4.  Your password.

Please promptly update your information if it changes by signing-in to your account and following the screen prompts. We strongly urge you to periodically change your password to help reduce the risk of unauthorised access to your account information.

Users in certain jurisdictions are, in accordance with applicable law, entitled to exercise a right of access to personal information about themselves by asking for a copy of the information we hold about them (for which, where allowed by law, we may charge a small fee). Please put any such request in writing and using our contact form: [Feedback](https://badoo.com/en/feedback/).

### Can I deactivate or delete my Profile?

Users of the Badoo network have the following choices to delete their profile from our database:

1.  Send a message via [Feedback page](https://badoo.com/en/feedback/)
2.  Sign in with your password and delete your profile. These options are available from your “Settings” page.

If you want to stop using your account it will be initially deactivated. This means that no user will be able to search for you on the website although they may still see you profile from direct cached links, but it will not be deleted. We save your profile information in case you later decide to restore your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to Badoo. You will therefore be able to restore your account and your profile in its entirety within 30 days of de-activating it.

After the expiration of 30 days, your account is permanently deleted from Badoo. We delete photographs from our servers within 14 days from the expiration of the deactivation period while other information (such as contact history) is deleted by us over a longer timescale, by way of housekeeping on a periodic basis. You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to restore it.

To prevent abuse and/or misuse of Badoo by a user following termination or deletion of a profile/account we shall retain such information as we deem in our sole discretion may be necessary to ensure that user does not open a new account and profile in breach of our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://badoo.com/en/terms/) and to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations.

**Warning:** Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or accessed on the Internet to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by other users or to the extent such information has been shared with search engines. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your personal information they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies.

Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 30 days to enable restoration, but will not be available to others in the meantime.

### What happens if I do nothing?

If you have not signed in to Badoo for three months, we may remove your Profile as part of our data cleansing process.

Your Badoo account is non-transferable and any rights to your profile or contents within your account will be cancelled upon your death.

If you have questions about our Privacy Policy or how we collect and use information, drop us a line via [Feedback page](https://badoo.com/en/feedback/).
