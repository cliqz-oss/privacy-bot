controls your personal data.

This Privacy Policy applies whenever you play our games or otherwise access
any of our other products, services, content, Zynga.com and/or the other
domains provided by Zynga, together referred to as "Services." This Privacy
Policy describes:

  * what information we collect, how we collect it, and why

## Information We Collect and How We Collect It

Information About You That We Get From Connected Third-Party Applications,
Including Social Networks (like Facebook)

If you play Zynga's games or access any of our other Services on connected
third-party applications or connect our Services to any third-party
applications, including social networks like Facebook, Zynga may receive
certain information about you from the provider of the third-party
application. The information we receive depends on the Zynga game you're
playing, the third-party application, your privacy settings and, if
applicable, your friends' privacy settings on that third-party application.

For example, Zynga may collect and store some or all of the following
information shared by the provider of the connected third-party application:

  * your first and last name; 
  * your profile picture or its URL; 
  * your user ID number (like your Facebook ID number), which may be linked to publicly-available information like your name and profile photo; 
  * the user ID number and other public data for your friends; 
  * the login e-mail you provided to that third-party application when you registered with it; 
  * your physical location and that of the devices you use to access our Services; 
  * your gender; 
  * your birthday and/or age range; 
  * information about your activities on or through the connected third-party application; 
  * other publicly-available information on the third-party application; and/or 
  * any other information that you or the provider of the third-party application share with Zynga. 

If you access our Services from a third-party application or connect our
Services to a third-party application, you should also read that third-party
application's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

If you are unclear about what information a third-party application is sharing
with us, please go to the third-party application to find out more about their
privacy practices.

Cookies and Automated Information Collection  
We and service providers acting on our behalf, like Google Analytics, store
log files and use tracking technologies such as:

  * cookies, which are small pieces of data transferred to your mobile device or computer for record-keeping purposes; 
  * web beacons, which let us know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; 
  * tracking pixels, which allow us or our advertising partners to advertise more efficiently and effectively; and 
  * local shared objects, also known as flash cookies, which help us to reduce fraud, remember your in-game preferences and speed up load times. 

We and our service providers use these log files, tags, and tracking
technologies to collect and analyze certain kinds of technical information,
including:

  * IP addresses; 
  * the type of computer or mobile device you are using; 
  * your operating system version; 
  * your mobile device's identifiers, like your MAC Address, Identifier For Advertising (IDFA), and/or International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI); 
  * your browser types; 
  * your browser language; 
  * referring and exit pages, and URLs; 
  * platform type; 
  * the number of clicks on a page or feature; 
  * domain names; 
  * landing pages; 
  * pages viewed and the order of those pages; 
  * the amount of time spent on particular pages; and 
  * game state and the date and time of activity on our websites or games. 

In some cases, we will connect this information with your social network ID or
Zynga user ID.

Please note that companies delivering advertisements on our Services may also
use cookies or other technologies as described below in Third Party
Advertising Including Tailored Advertising and Analytics, and those practices
are subject to those companies' own policies.

For more information on how to limit the types of cookies you allow, please
see Opting out of Cookie Tracking.

Other Information from Your Mobile Device  
If you play Zynga games on your mobile device, in addition to your device
identifiers, we may also collect:

  * the name you have associated with your device; 
  * your telephone number; 
  * your country; and 
  * your specific geolocation; 
  * your mobile contacts (as further described below in "Information About Your Contacts"); and 
  * information about Zynga and other third-party apps you have on your device. 

If you want to adjust your privacy preferences on your mobile device, please
see How to Access, Update and Manage Your Information.

Information About You That You Share With Us Directly  
When you use our Services (whether through a social network or through Zynga
directly), you may give us information directly (like when you're setting up
your account) and we will store that on our systems and use it for the
purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

Some games or parts of our Services may use a more traditional registration or
account set-up process where you may be asked to give us some or all of the
following information:

  * your age or birthday; 
  * your first and last names; 
  * your e-mail address; 
  * a password; and 
  * other information that helps us make sure it's you accessing your account or helps us improve our services. 

We may also let you create a player profile, separate from your social
networking site profile (for example, your Facebook profile), that other Zynga
players can see. Your player profile may include information like:

  * a profile photo; 
  * game username(s); 
  * your gender; 
  * biographic details (like your age or age range); 
  * approximate location information that you provide; 
  * links to your profiles on various social network; 
  * details about the games you play; and 
  * a Zynga player ID number that is created by Zynga and used to identify your profile. 

Certain information in your Zynga profile may be publicly accessible on
Zynga's websites that offer direct access to Zynga games, including:

  * The Zynga player ID; 
  * Your first and last names; and 
  * Your player profile picture. 

Except for games designed for children under 13, your Zynga player ID number
used to identify your account and player profile will appear in the URL of
your profile page. It will only allow access to information you make public in
your settings.

Information About Your Contacts  
We may give you the ability to import your address book contacts or manually
enter them so that you can locate your contacts on Zynga and invite them to
join you in our games or other aspects of our Services. You are responsible
for getting your contacts' permission when you opt to give their contact
details to us. We may also get information about you from other Zynga users
importing or entering their contacts. We use and may store this contact
information to help you and your contacts connect through our Services. If you
want to remove your contacts stored by us, follow the instructions provided in
the game to request that we remove them from our systems. If you need to enter
a password to allow us to access your address book, we will not store that
password.

Information You Generate Using Our Communications Features  
Except for games designed for children under 13, you may be able to take part
in certain activities on our Service that let you communicate or share
information not just with Zynga, but also with other Zynga players. These
include:

  * participating in player forums and message boards; 
  * posting public comments to other players' profiles or gameboards; 
  * sending private messages or invitations to other players, either directly on our websites or to their e-mail accounts; 
  * chatting with other players; and/or 
  * posting photos or drawings. 

You acknowledge and expressly agree that we may access in real-time, record
and/or store archives of these communications, comments, photos and drawings
on Zynga's servers to make use of them to protect the safety and well-being of
our players and Zynga's rights and property in connection with our Services;
to conduct research; to operate, improve, personalize and optimize our
Services and our players' experiences, including through the use of analytics;
and to manage and deliver contextual advertising.

Payment Information  
If you purchase a license to use in-game virtual currency or virtual items in
a game you play on Zynga.com, our third-party payment processor will collect
the billing and financial information it needs to process your charges. This
may include your postal address, e-mail address and financial information.
Zynga does not collect or store your financial information, like credit card
numbers. However, Zynga's payment processors may share non-financial
information with us related to your purchases, like your name, billing address
and the items purchased in order to fulfill your order. Zynga may also obtain
the billing and payment information that you provide when your purchase is
processed by someone else (like Facebook, Apple or Google) such as when you
purchase something in a game you play on a social network or that you
downloaded on your mobile device. Our Terms of Service explain our policies
and terms relevant to our charges, billing practices, third-party credits and
virtual currencies. Please note that purchases of third party credits or
currencies may also be subject to those parties' policies.

Customer Support Correspondence  
Except as provided herein, when you ask for help from our Customer Support
team, we will collect and store the contact information you give them
(generally, your name and e-mail address), information about your game play or
activity on our Services, and your Zynga player and/or social network ID
number. We will also store the communications you have with the Customer
Service team and any information in those communications in order to provide
support and improve the Services. For users of our games designed for children
under 13, we will use your contact information for the sole purpose of
providing a one-time response to your question. We will then delete your
information from our servers.

Information You Give Us For Text Messaging Services  
We receive and store the information you provide, including your mobile
telephone number, when you choose to sign up to receive SMS messages.

Game Toolbars or Game Bars  
You may have installed a Zynga-branded toolbar (the "Toolbar") when playing
various games. The Toolbar is based on technology provided by Conduit, a third
party, whose privacy policy is available here.

The Toolbar will automatically update on your browser with improvements. The
Toolbar itself may collect information like your social network ID. Some
Toolbar features may let you provide personal information (for example,
Contact form, Tell-a-friend). We may also keep statistics regarding how
players use the toolbar on an aggregated basis. For more info on the Toolbar
and instructions for uninstalling it go here.

Other Sources  
We may collect or receive information about you from other sources like third-
party information providers. We use this information along with information
you provide us directly, for example, to help you and your friends connect or
to serve you advertising more tailored to your interests.

If you would like to learn more about how we secure your information, please
see Security of Your Information.

## How We Use the Information We Collect

The main use of the information we collect and store is to provide a better
gaming experience, but there are other uses as well. The uses for which we
collect and store your information include:

  * to operate, improve and optimize our Services and our players' experiences; 
  * to create your game accounts and allow you to play our games; 
  * to identify and suggest connections with other Zynga players and personalize our Services to you; 
  * to enable players to communicate with each other; 
  * to provide technical support and respond to player inquiries; 
  * to protect the safety and well-being of our players; 
  * to protect Zynga's rights and property in connection with our Services; 
  * to prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Terms of Service; 
  * to manage and deliver contextual and behavioral advertising; 
  * to notify players of in-game updates, new products or promotional offers; 
  * to administer rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by us or our business partners; 
  * to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes we may have with you or other players, and to enforce our agreements with third parties; and 
  * to conduct research. 

One important use of your information is communication. If you have provided
your e-mail address to Zynga, we will use it to respond to customer support
inquiries, and keep you informed of your in-game activity, including comments
from friends, let you know about in-game status such as "crops ready" as well
as tell you about gift and neighbor requests. Some messages, like invites for
friends to join you in a game, may include your name and profile photo. We may
also send promotional e-mail messages and promotional SMS messages (e.g. text
messages) ("Promotional Communications") directly or in partnership with other
parties, in accordance with your marketing preferences. Each Promotional
Communication will offer you choices about receiving additional messages.
Receipt of such communications depends on Zynga having certain contact
information from you. If you play one of our games designed for children under
13, you will not be able to provide us with certain contact information.
Please see the section on Our Policies Concerning Children for more
information.

## How We Share Your Information

We may disclose or publish aggregated information (information about you and
other players collectively that is not intended to specifically identify you,
for example, players between the ages of 21 and 25 who live San Francisco) and
other non-personal information about our players for industry analysis,
demographic profiling, marketing, analytics, advertising, and other business
purposes.  
In addition, we may share your information (which may include personal
information) with third parties (in other words, parties other than Zynga) or
allow third parties to collect this information from our Services in the
following circumstances:

Your Consent  
With your consent, we may share your information with third parties or allow
them to collect your information from our Services in some ways not
specifically described in this Privacy Policy.

Friends and Other Zynga Players  
The Service supports and often encourages you to interact with other players.
In most Zynga games, if you play through a social network or register through
a social network (for example, Facebook Connect), your social network friends
will see your name, profile photo and descriptions of your game activity.
Similarly, in many Zynga games, other players, regardless of whether they are
your social network friends or not, will be able to see descriptions of your
game activity (including the identification of any Zynga games you have
played), communicate with you within our Services, and view your game profile,
which may include your name or a "game name" and your profile photo. For
example, in Zynga Poker, any other player may see your game profile if you are
playing at the same table. In certain cases, your profile photo can reveal
your social network ID or Zynga player ID, and access to a social network ID
or Zynga player ID may allow others to view the public information associated
with your related social network profile or Zynga account. Other players may
also be able to send you game requests or even friend requests through the
related social network's or Zynga's communication channels.

Third-Party Advertising Including Tailored Advertising and Analytics  
We have advertising on our Services so we can continue to offer many of our
Services for free.

We do not actively share personal information with third-party advertisers for
their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your consent.

When advertisers or ad networks place ads in our Services, they may collect or
we may share the following types of information from within our Services:

  * performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement); 
  * aggregated and/or de-identified information about you and other players collectively that is not intended to specifically identify you (like players between the ages of 21 and 25 who live San Francisco); 
  * certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-persistent device identifiers such as IDFAs, and de-identified persistent device identifiers such as a hashed Android ID); 
  * your social network ID; 
  * and other contextual data about your game play (for example, your level and session length). 

The information collected may be used to:

  * measure how effective ads are, to offer you targeted advertising in order to personalize your experience by showing you advertisements for products and services that are more likely to appeal to you (a practice known as behavioral advertising), and/or 
  * undertake web analytics (like Google Analytics which is used to analyze traffic and other player activity to improve your experience). 

Advertisers or ad networks may collect this information through the use of
tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons, and they may use a
single tracking technology or multiple tracking technologies at the same time.

Please note, after clicking on a third party advertisement, you may no longer
be on a site hosted by Zynga or the social network through which you are
playing Zynga's games.

If you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from
third parties, please see How to Access, Update and Manage Your Information.
Please note that no tailored advertisements will be delivered for Zynga games
designed for children under 13, though Zynga may allow contextual
advertisements to be displayed.

Safety, Security and Compliance with Law  
Your information, and the contents of all of your online communications in our
Services and between You and Zynga may be accessed and monitored as needed to
provide our Service and may be disclosed:

  * when we have a good faith belief that we have to disclose the information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); 
  * to satisfy any laws or regulations that apply; 
  * where we believe in our sole discretion that the Service is being used in committing a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to share information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection, credit risk reduction, and other security precautions; 
  * when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of you, another person or the public generally; and 
  * to protect the rights or property of Zynga and other applicable third parties, including to enforce our Terms of Service. 

Offer Walls  
Zynga games or their purchase pages may display an "offer wall" that is hosted
by an offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third-party advertisers to
provide virtual currency to players in exchange for interacting with an
advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up
for an account with one of those advertisers. These offers are not made by
Zynga. These offers may be shown to you based on certain technical
information, like your geographic area or de-identified demographic
information. After clicking on one of these offers, you will no longer be on a
site hosted by Zynga or the social network through which you are playing
Zynga's games. To properly credit player accounts and to prevent fraud, a
unique identifier, in some cases your social network ID or Zynga player ID,
will be shared with the offer wall provider.

Third-Party Service Providers  
We will share your information with third-party companies to perform services
on our behalf, like processing payments, analyzing data, optimizing game play,
e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service and to help us in our
marketing efforts, including managing and delivering contextual and tailored
advertisements. We contractually require these third-party service providers
to maintain the confidentiality of the information we share with them, and we
contractually require them not use your information for anything other than to
provide services on our behalf.

Sale or Merger  
In the event that Zynga undergoes a business transition (including proposed
transactions), like a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all
or part its assets (like selling a game), we may disclose or transfer all of
your information, including personal information, to the successor
organization in the transition. We will make reasonable efforts to let you and
other players know (in the way described in Changes to Our Privacy Policy) of
the business transition before transferring your personal information.

## How to Access, Update and Manage Your Information

Information We Receive From a Third-Party Application Where You Play Our Games
or From Your Mobile Device

To manage the information Zynga receives about you from a third-party
application where you play our games, like Facebook, you will need to follow
the instructions for the third-party application for updating your information
and changing your privacy settings. The privacy management tools for
applications on Facebook can be found here. To review and update information
associated with your Zynga game profile in certain games, visit the "settings"
page in that game. You also can manage some aspects of information collection
and use by visiting the "settings" page of your mobile device and reviewing
the permissions of each application or "app."

Once Zynga receives your information from a third-party application or your
mobile device, that information is stored and used by Zynga in accordance with
this Privacy Policy. You may access and update that information as described
below.

Accessing and Updating Your Information Held by Zynga  
If you want to review, delete, or change the information Zynga has about you
or have additional questions, e-mail us at privacy@zynga.com, or for Black
Diamond Slots support@risingtidegames.com. For requests to review, delete or
change the information obtained in connection with NaturalMotion games, email
us at contact@naturalmotion.com. We will respond to your request within thirty
days.

Stopping Use of Your Information  
If you no longer want Zynga to make active use of your information, you may
send an e-mail to privacy@zynga.com (or if you play NaturalMotion games, send
an email to contact@naturalmotion.com). Place "Delete My Account" in the
subject line and include your first name, last name, e-mail address and your
social network ID for the social network from which you access our Services
(if applicable) in the body of the e-mail (for example, your Facebook user
ID). We will respond to your request within thirty days. Please note that
certain records, for example those relating to payments or customer service
matters, will be held for legal and accounting purposes. If you have sent
content through or posted content on the Service, we may not be able to delete
it.

Opting Out of Geolocation  
If you have previously allowed us to access your geolocation data, you can
stop making geolocation available to us by visiting your mobile device's
settings for the relevant application or the "settings" page for the relevant
game.

Opting Out of Ongoing Collection of Information About Non-Zynga Apps You Have
On Your Device  
To the extent that one of our games is collecting information about non-Zynga
apps you have on your device, the game will provide you with an option to stop
making that information available to us in the "settings" page for the
relevant game.

Opting Out of Promotional Emails from Zynga  
If you want to stop receiving promotional e-mails from Zynga, click on the
"unsubscribe" link in any promotional email from Zynga or visit the e-mail
preference page. Please note that once we receive your request, it may take an
additional period of time for your opt-out to become effective. Your
unsubscribe or e-mail preference change will be processed promptly, and in no
event longer than ten business days.

Opting Out of Other Communications  
You can opt out of receiving SMS messages (for example, text messages) by
texting back STOP to the number we send the text from for that particular SMS
message program. In some cases a preferences management page will also be
available. When we receive an opt-out message from you for SMS messages, we
may send a message confirming our receipt of your opt-out.

When you install our apps on your mobile device you can choose to receive push
notifications, which are messages an app sends you on your mobile device even
when the app is not on. You can turn off notifications by visiting your mobile
device's "settings" page.

Opting Out of Black Diamond Slots Communications  
You may opt out of all communications for Black Diamond Slots by sending an
email to support@risingtidegames.com

Note that if you opt-out of our Promotional Communications or other forms of
communication, we may still e-mail or communicate with you from time to time
if we need to provide you with information about the Service or if we need to
request information from you with respect to a transaction initiated by you or
for other legitimate non-marketing reasons, for example, if we update this
Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.

Opting Out of Third-Party Tailored Advertising  
If you are interested in more information about tailored advertising and your
choices to prevent third parties from delivering tailored web and mobile web
advertising you may visit the following websites:

  * Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page for U.S.-based advertising; and 
  * Your Online Choices UK website for EU-based advertising. 

These opt-out tools are provided by third parties, not Zynga. Zynga does not
control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others
provide through these tools.

In addition, if you do not want to receive tailored in-application
advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests in apps on
your mobile device, you may opt- ut by adjusting the ad tracking settings on
your device. You can also reset the "Advertising Identifier" (like an IDFA)
from your mobile device's settings page, which will prevent continued use of
existing behavioral data tied to the previous "Advertising Identifier."
Further, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may
be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance's
"AppChoices" app, that offer to provide you with control regarding the
collection and use of cross-app data for tailored advertising. Like the opt-
out tools mentioned above for web, these mobile opt-out tools are provided by
third parties, not Zynga. Zynga does not control or operate these tools or the
choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.

Please note that you may still receive advertisements from third parties
within Zynga's games even if you opt out of tailored advertising but they will
not be based on your activity across unrelated web sites or apps.

Opting Out of Cookie Tracking

You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on
your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate
differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a
web browser may not remove flash cookies. To learn more about and manage flash
cookies you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at the Global Privacy
Settings Panel.

If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of
our Services because Zynga cookies are necessary to track and enhance your
game activities.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice

At this time, there is no general agreement on how companies like Zynga should
interpret Do Not Track signals. Zynga does not currently respond to Do Not
Track signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile
device. You can learn more about Do Not Track here.

## Privacy Policies of Linked Third-Party Services and Advertisers

Our websites and games may contain advertisements from Third-Party Services,
which are companies other than Zynga that may link to their own websites,
online services or mobile applications. We are not responsible for the privacy
practices or the content of these Third-Party Services. If you have any
questions about how these Third-Party Services use your information, you
should review their policies and contact them directly.

## Our Policies Concerning Children

Most of our websites and games are not for children under the age of 13 and we
do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13.
Children under 13 should not use these websites or games at any time. If we
learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from a child
under 13, we will take reasonable measures to promptly remove that information
from our records.

Zynga provides education games, like Words with Friends EDU, which are
intended to be enjoyed by parents, teachers, and children of all ages. Zynga
may also provide games like Looney Tunes Dash, which are intended for users of
all ages. In these games, Zynga does not knowingly collect personal
information (as that term is defined under the Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act (COPPA)) from users under the age of 13, except as permitted by
COPPA. For example, Zynga may collect persistent identifiers to support the
internal operations of its games. If Zynga learns that a child under the age
of 13 has provided us with personal information that is not subject to a COPPA
exception, Zynga will delete such information.

## International Operations and Transfers Out of Switzerland and the EEA

IMPORTANT: When you use Our Services, your data may be sent to the United
States and possibly other countries.

If you don't live in the United States, Zynga Game Ireland Ltd. will control
your personal data.

As part of our international operations, we may transfer data to our
Affiliates (which means subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures and
other corporate entities under common ownership with Zynga Inc.) from time to
time for our legitimate business purposes. For example, Zynga Inc. provides
certain services to its Affiliates.

We store information about players and visitors to our sites on servers
located in the United States, and we may also store this information on
servers and equipment in other countries. Personal data collected within
Switzerland and the European Economic Area ("EEA") may be transferred to, and
stored at, a destination outside of Switzerland and the EEA. The data we hold
may also be processed by employees operating outside of Switzerland and the
EEA who work for us or one of our Affiliates or for one of our vendors. This
staff may be engaged in, among other things, (i) the processing of
transactions and your payment details and (ii) the provision of support
services. When we transfer your personal information internationally we will
take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated
securely, lawfully and in the manner we describe here. Please note that laws
vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and so the privacy laws applicable to
the places where your information is transferred to or stored, used or
processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the place
where you are resident.

Zynga has certified compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, effective as
of the date our certification is posted at https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.
We adhere to the relevant Privacy Shield Principles for all personal data
received from participating European countries in reliance on the Privacy
Shield framework.

We have also certified with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework regarding the
collection, use, and retention of personal information from Switzerland. We
adhere to the applicable U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles for
personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Safe Harbor. We may
process some data from individuals or companies in Switzerland via other
compliance mechanisms, including data processing agreements based on the EU
Standard Contractual Clauses.

To learn more about the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor program, and to view our
certification, please visit https://safeharbor.export.gov/swisslist.aspx.  
Participating European countries’ citizens and Swiss citizens should direct
any questions, concerns or complaints regarding Zynga’s handling of personal
information or compliance with the Privacy Shield or US-Swiss Safe Harbor to

We will attempt to answer your questions and satisfy your concerns in a timely
and complete manner. If, after discussing the matter with us, your question or
complaint is not resolved, you may seek further assistance, at no cost to you,
from JAMS at https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield, which is an
independent dispute resolution body in the United States. PLEASE CONTACT ZYNGA
FIRST.

If your complaint still is not resolved through these channels, under limited
circumstances more fully described on the Privacy Shield website
https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint, an
additional binding arbitration option may be available to you.

You may exercise any rights you have to correct, amend or deleted information
about you as described in the “How to Access, Update and Manage Your
Information” section above.  
When Zynga receives information under the Privacy Shield and then transfers it
to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on our behalf, Zynga has
certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the
information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) Zynga is
responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy
Shield Framework, Zynga is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers
of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

## How Long We Keep Your Information

How long we retain your information depends on why we collected it and how we
use it. We will not retain your personal information for longer than is
necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements. For instance,
we may retain some information for a few years after you have closed your
account with us if this is necessary to meet our legal obligations or to
exercise, defend or establish legal rights.

## Security of Your Information

We implement security measures to help protect the security of your
information both online and offline. We take steps to ensure that your data is
treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These measures
vary based upon the sensitivity of your information.

If you have an account registered directly with Zynga, your profile
information is protected by the password you use to access your Zynga account.
It is important that you protect and maintain your Zynga account's security
and that you immediately tell us of any unauthorized use of your account. If
you forget the password to your Zynga account, the Service allows you to
request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your
password. If you access our Services through a social network and your social
network account is hacked, this may lead to someone playing your Zynga games
without your permission. So, be careful to keep your social network account
information, including your social network account password, secure as well.
We urge you to log out of your Zynga account and any social network account
you have used to access our Services after you use it.

When you sign into your Zynga account or enter payment information, we or our
third party payment processor use encryption to transmit that information.  
While we take precautions against possible security breaches of our Services
and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is
completely secure. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data
loss, or other breaches will never occur, and we cannot guarantee the security
of your information while it is being transmitted to our Service. Any
transmission is at your own risk. If you have questions about the security of
our websites, please contact us at privacy@zynga.com.

to the change becoming effective. We may supplement this process by placing
notices on game blogs, social network pages, and/or forums and on other Zynga
websites. You should periodically check www.zynga.com and this privacy page
for updates.
