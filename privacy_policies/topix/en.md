### Digital Millennium Copyright Act

It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov/) and other applicable intellectual property laws, which may include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity. If we remove or disable access to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of each affected site so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of that Act. It is our policy to document all notices of alleged infringement on which we act. A copy of the notice will be sent to a third party who will make it available to the public.

To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide a written communication (by fax or regular mail -- not by email, except by prior agreement) that sets forth the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that a product or activity is infringing your copyrights. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether certain material of yours is protected by copyright laws, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.

To expedite our ability to process your request, please use the following format (including section numbers):

1.  Identify in sufficient detail the copyrighted work that you believe has been infringed. For example, "The copyrighted work at issue is the text that appears on www.Topix.net/ads."
2.  Identify the material that you claim is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item \#1 above.
3.  Provide information reasonably sufficient to permit Topix.net to contact you (email address is preferred).
4.  Provide information, if possible, sufficient to permit Topix.net to notify the owner/administrator of the web page that allegedly contains infringing material (email address is preferred).
5.  Include the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law."
6.  Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."
7.  Sign the paper.

Send the written communication to 1001 Elwell Court, Palo Alto, CA 94303.

### Counter Notification

The administrator of an affected site may make a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. When we receive a counter notification, we will reinstate the material in question.

To file a counter notification with us, you must provide a written communication (by fax or regular mail -- not by email, except by prior agreement) that sets forth the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that a product or activity is not infringing the copyrights of others. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether certain material infringes the copyrights of others, we suggest that you first contact an attorney. A sample counter notification may be found at <http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca/counter512.pdf>.

To expedite our ability to process your counter notification, please use the following format (including section numbers):

1.  Identify the specific URLs of material that Topix.net has removed or to which Topix.net has disabled access.
2.  Provide your name, address, telephone number, email address, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or Santa Clara County, California if your address is outside of the United States), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.
3.  Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that each search result or message identified above was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."
4.  Sign the paper.

Send the written communication to 1001 Elwell Court, Palo Alto, CA 94303.

### []()Trademark Compliance

As a provider of space for advertisements, please note that Topix.net is not in a position to arbitrate trademark disputes between the advertisers and trademark owners. As stated in our Terms and Conditions, the advertisers themselves are responsible for the ad text that they choose to use. Accordingly, we encourage trademark owners to resolve their disputes directly with the advertisers, particularly because the advertisers may have similar advertisements on other sites.

If you are a trademark owner (or represent a trademark owner) and have an objection to an advertiser's use of your trademark in ad text that is consistent with the foregoing, please provide the following information in a signed letter on company stationary:

1.  Name of Company
2.  Contact information (including email address)
3.  List of trademark(s) at issue and the country/countries in which it is registered
4.  The identity of the advertisement(s) at issue (via the URL stated on the bottom line of the ad)
5.  The content in the advertisement that concerns you.
6.  If your site has an affiliate program, are affiliates permitted to use the trademark in the advertisement's content?
7.  Include the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the trademarks described above with the advertisements described above is not authorized by the trademark owner or its agent, nor is such use otherwise permissible under law."
8.  Include the following statement: "I represent that the information in this notification is true and correct and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the trademark owner."
9.  Your signature.

Please send this written communication with the above information to the address on our [contact page](/topix/contact).

Please Note: The foregoing procedure applies only to the use of trademarks in advertisements, which are clearly marked as advertisement on our pages. We do not take action on objections to the use of trademarks in site to which we link. For any such objections, please contact the site owner directly.

Upon your first visit to Topix.com, Topix sends a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique user. Topix uses cookies to improve the quality of our service and to understand our user base more. Topix does this by storing user preferences in cookies and by tracking user trends and patterns of how people use the Topix Services.

### What Information Do We Collect?

Topix does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. For example, Topix DOES collect such information from those users registering as Community Users and/or User Editors. Topix notes and saves information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, mobile device identifiers, and IP address with each query. That information is used to verify our records and to provide more relevant services to users. For example, Topix may use your IP address or browser language to determine which language to use when showing search results or advertisements.

### Links to Other Sites

The stories/sites displayed and/or linked to by the Topix.com Service are developed by people over whom Topix exercises no control. Other links are also on sites not controlled by Topix. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Topix encourages you to read the privacy policy of all web sites you visit. Topix may choose to exhibit its results in the form of a "URL redirecter." When Topix uses a URL redirecter, if you click on a URL on a Topix page, information about the click is sent to Topix, and Topix in turn sends you to the site you clicked on. Topix uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Topix's technology.

### With Whom Does Topix Share Information?

Topix may share information about you with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only divulge aggregate information about our users and will not share personally identifiable information with any third party without your express consent.

Please be aware, however, that we will release specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order. Further, Topix reserves the right to cooperate with legitimate law enforcement requests for information at its sole discretion.
