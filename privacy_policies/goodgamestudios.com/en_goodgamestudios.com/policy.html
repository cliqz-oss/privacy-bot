This means that we cannot see the personal data of any individual user. However, the collected data are saved and processed by Facebook.

<p>If you would like to register for one of our services via your Facebook account, the first step of the registration process will immediately redirect you to Facebook.

Information of this type generally includes your name, profile picture and cover photo, your networks, your username (Facebook URL), and your user ID number (Facebook ID).

The data will be created automatically by our system and can be customized by you later with an e-mail address and password of your choosing.

This information includes, for example, your name, address, email address, and other personal information that Goodgame Studios may inquire into in individual cases. In many cases, use of Goodgame Studios’ services is possible using a pseudonym. Users are encouraged to make use of this possibility.</p>

If you want, for example, to create a profile picture from within the app, we need access to your camera or photo album. If you want to buy additional content through the app, we may need access to the necessary interface to your app store account. Another example is so-called &#8220;push notifications&#8221;, in which we can use an interface to display a message directly on your end device.</p>
<p>The access permissions on your mobile device are dependent on the operating system (e.g. Android, iOS, etc.) and the store where the app was purchased (e.g. Google Play Store, Apple App Store, Amazon, etc.). You generally receive information on which access permissions are required by our apps prior to installation.</p>
<p>In Apple <strong>iOS</strong>, see &#8220;Settings&#8221; at any time for an overview of what content our apps can access. You can restrict these access permissions at a later time.</p>
<p>In <strong>Android</strong>, various access permissions are also needed on your mobile device. Under &#8220;Settings / Apps&#8221;, you can review the access permissions of our apps.</td>
