stored by Goodgame Studios. Alternatively, you can also contact us using the
above postal address. If possible, please include the online or mobile game
that you have played, the server, and your player name.  
3 Collection of information  
In principle, you can access our internet offers without disclosing any
personal information to us. It is always your choice whether or not to provide
us with your personal information. We collect your information in order to
fulfill the user contract we have agreed upon with you. In addition to
monitoring compliance with the terms of use and game rules, this includes in
particular the proper handling of your payment arrangements.

We require personal information if you would like to register on our websites,
participate in sweepstakes, or subscribe to our newsletter. This information
includes, for example, your name, address, email address, and other personal
information that Goodgame Studios may inquire into in individual cases. In
many cases, it is possible to use Goodgame Studios' services with pseudonyms.
Users are encouraged to make use of this feature.

In addition, certain pieces of information such as IP address, browser
version, and access times are automatically sent to us by your computer or
mobile device and stored on our server. Information regarding the type of
mobile device and operating system being used is also collected at this time.
We only use this information to conduct statistical and performance analyses
or to prosecute unauthorized use of our website. The information remains
anonymous whenever possible. We reserve the right to carry out personalized
campaigns using the personal information that you have permitted social
networks to share with third parties. In this regard, we shall refer to the
privacy policies of the social networks in question.

We gather, process, and use personal information only with your consent,
unless already permitted by legal statutes. If consent is given electronically
within the context of our online offerings, we shall fulfill our legal
obligation to give you proper notification of this.

We do not knowingly collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age.  
4 Cookies  
We use cookies on our website. These are small text files stored on your
computer. We use both permanent cookies and session cookies so that we can
offer you the best service possible. The data saved in the cookies make the
use of our services as comfortable as possible for you, not only for your
current use of the respective service but also beyond it.

If you don't want to allow permanent cookies, you can select the option to
deactivate permanent cookies in your browser.

The data stored in session cookies are only valid for the current visit to our
online offers and serve to provide you with an unrestricted use of our
services and to make the use of our offers and services as comfortable as
possible for your current visit. If you deactivate session cookies, we cannot
guarantee that you will be able to use all of our services without
limitations.  
5 Cookies of third party providers and tracking  
We use the services of other companies to optimize our websites and our
services. You will receive an overview of the services we use in the following
section.  
a. Google Analytics  
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by
Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies, text files stored on
your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The
information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including
your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the
United States. We use Google Analytics with the add-on "_anonymizeIP()" so
that the IP addresses later transmitted to Google are shortened and modified
in advance on the European servers to prevent any direct references to
particular persons. Google will use this information for the purpose of
evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for
website operators, and providing other services relating to website activity
and internet usage to the website operator. Your IP address, which has been
transmitted by Google Analytics, will not be associated with any other data
held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate
settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may
not be able to use all functions of this website. Furthermore, you can
prohibit Google from collecting and analyzing the cookie generated data about
your use of the website (including your IP address) by clicking here or
downloading and installing the browser plugin available here
http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.

If you visit our website using a mobile device (e.g. a smartphone or tablet),
you can refuse the future use of Google Analytics via this link. By activating
the link, we will put a cookie in your browser, which signals to us that we
should prevent Google Analytics from using your device. Please keep in mind
that you will have to repeat the refusal process if you remove the cookies
from your browser.  
b. Google Remarketing  
Our websites use Google's remarketing technology. This technology enables
users who have already visited our online services and shown interest in our
services to see targeted advertising on the websites of the Google partner
network. Likewise users that are similar to the visitors of our websites can
be addressed. The advertising will be displayed using cookies. These are small
text files saved on the user's computer. The information generated by the
cookie about the website use will be transmitted to and stored on servers in
the United States by Google. In the event that the IP address is transferred,
it will be reduced by the last 3 digits. Using cookies, the user behavior on a
website can be analyzed and subsequently utilized to provide targeted product
recommendations and advertising based on the user's interests.

If you would prefer to not receive any targeted advertising, you can
deactivate the use of cookies for these purposes through Google by visiting
the website: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/. Alternatively, users can
deactivate the use of cookies by third party providers by visiting the Network
Advertising Initiative's deactivation website
(http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

Please note that Google has its own data protection policy which is
independent of our own. We assume no responsibility or liability for their
policies and procedures. Please read Google's privacy policy before using our
websites (https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/).  
c. Facebook Conversion Tracking Pixel  
With your permission, our website utilizes the Conversion Tracking Pixel
service of Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA
("Facebook"). This tool allows us to follow the actions of users after they
are redirected to a provider's website by clicking on a Facebook
advertisement. We are thus able to record the efficacy of Facebook
advertisements for statistical and market research purposes. The collected
data remain anonymous. This means that we cannot see the personal data of any
individual user. However, the collected data are saved and processed by
Facebook. We are informing you on this matter according to our information at
this time. Facebook is able to connect the data with your Facebook account and
use the data for their own advertising purposes, in accordance with Facebook's
Data Use Policy found under: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. Facebook
Conversion Tracking also allows Facebook and its partners to show you
advertisements on and outside Facebook. In addition, a cookie will be saved
onto your computer for these purposes.

Only users over 13 years of age may give their permission. If you are younger
than this age, please consult your legal guardians.

Please click here if you would like to revoke your permission:  
https://www.facebook.com/ads/website_custom_audiences/.  
d. Facebook login  
We also offer you an easier way to register for our games and services. You
can use your existing Facebook account for this purpose. By clicking the Login
with Facebook link, you can use this registration method via our online
portal. To do this, you need to already have a Facebook account or have access
to Facebook.

If you would like to register for one of our services via your Facebook
account, the first step of the registration process will immediately redirect
you to Facebook. Facebook will then ask you to log in or register. At no time
will we have access to your personal login information (username and
password).

In a second step, you will connect your Facebook profile with the service that
you would like to register for. At this point, you will learn what data from
your Facebook profile will be transmitted to us. This information is usually
your "public information" on Facebook and information that you have made
available to the public or authorized for the application in question.
Information of this type generally includes your name, profile picture and
cover photo, your networks, your username (Facebook URL), and your user ID
number (Facebook ID). We will also use the email address you have saved with
Facebook in order to contact you outside of Facebook. You can see an overview
of the public information in your profile via the General Account Settings
menu of your Facebook profile
(https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications).

If you would like to remove our service's connection to Facebook via Facebook
Connect, please log in to Facebook and make the required changes to your
profile. We will then no longer have the right to use information from your
Facebook profile for you.  
e. Twitter Conversion Tracking  
We use the Conversion Tracking service of Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite
600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA ("Twitter"). This tracking records if a user
of our website clicks on a link posted by Twitter. In this way, both we and
Twitter can see if a registration has taken place. The identity of the user
remains anonymous. In addition, we use Twitter's Tailored Audiences service.
This enables us to appeal to our website's users with targeted advertisements.
To do this, Twitter uses a code snippet (tag) which we have integrated into
our website. No personal data are collected during this process. Tailored
Audiences is also used to create lookalike targeting lists.

You can find more information about Twitter's privacy policy in their data
privacy statement (https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en). You can adjust your
privacy settings for tailored advertisements at this link:
https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170405-your-privacy-controls-for-
tailored-ads Twitter also supports "Do Not Track" (DNT). If you have activated
this option in your browser, Twitter will not receive any browser-related
information (browser cookie ID) from web partners in order to tailor their
advertisements to you.  
6 Use of your personal information  
We use your personal data in order to constantly improve our range of services
and to satisfy users' needs.

We use your personal information for the establishment, processing, and
settlement of your user relationship with Goodgame Studios and the processing
of payments.

Furthermore, we use your information in order to communicate with you. This
communication includes emails informing you on new features in our services
where appropriate. We use your personal information in order to inform you
about products, services, or certain events which could be of interest to you
on a regular basis. Each message contains the text: "In order to stop
receiving emails for this game account in the future, please click here".
After clicking on "here", you will no longer receive messages regarding this
game account. Your refusal will not incur any costs other than the
transmission costs in accordance with basic tariffs.

Finally, we use your information in order to protect our webpages and to trace
unauthorized accesses.  
7 Transmission of personal information  
As a matter of course, your data will not be sold to third parties. Goodgame
Studios transmits your personal data to third parties only to the following
extent:

We are collaborating with payment providers (e.g. credit card companies,
banks, PayPal, mobile services, debt collection agencies, etc.), providers
that create and compile statistical data, and IT service providers (e.g., data
centers, hosts, backup services, database services). These service providers
only have access to your data to the extent necessary for the completion of
their tasks. These service providers are required to handle your data in
accordance with this privacy policy and the relevant data protection statutes.

In the case that Goodgame Studios, companies controlled by Goodgame Studios,
certain affiliated companies, or shares of the company are sold, your customer
information will ordinarily be passed on with the part of the company that is
changing hands. As a matter of course, your data shall remain subject to this
privacy policy and the relevant data protection statutes in a case such as
this.  
8 More information about the privacy policy  
Please keep in mind that all information you choose to make public, e.g. in
chats, via email, or in forums or comments, can be collected and used by
others.

For our own liability, we maintain the right to review this content. In
addition, we shall strive to clarify and prevent any fradulent measures (e.g.
illegal game rigging at the expense of Goodgame) via independent reviews.  
9 Changing or deletion of data  
As a registered user you can review, update, correct or delete your personal
data in your profile settings or by contacting us at:
https://support.goodgamestudios.com/.

Goodgame Studios will delete personal data upon request, unless mandatory
obligations contradict such a deletion.  
10 Security of your personal information  
The data collected from you is processed according to the German Data
Protection Act. All employees are obliged and have been advised to maintain
data confidentiality and privacy obligations.

When submitting payments, the transfer of your information is protected by SSL
encryption technology. Our SSL transfer is GoDaddy certified.

1 Scope of this Privacy Policy  
This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile applications (apps) offered under
the responsibility of Goodgame Studios.

Unless stated otherwise, solely this Privacy Policy regulates how Goodgame
Studios treats your personal data. In the event that you are using services of
third parties, the policy of these third parties shall apply exclusively.  
2 Responsible party  
The "responsible party", within the meaning of the Federal Data Protection Act
(Bundesdatenschutzgesetz) is: Altigi GmbH / Goodgame Studios, Theodorstr.
42-90, Haus 9, 22761 Hamburg.

If you have any questions about privacy, please contact
privacy@goodgamestudios.com. You can use this address at any time to ask
questions about data protection, to query which data are saved by Goodgame
Studios, or to have such edited or deleted. Alternatively, you can contact us
by post at the above mailing address. Please submit, where possible, the name
of the online or mobile game you play, the server and your player name.  
3 Data collection upon download  
When you download the app, no information is actively transmitted by us to the
respective app store (Apple App Store, Google Play, Amazon, Windows, etc.). If
you want to know which data are collected and processed by the respective app
store as part of a download, please inform yourself with their privacy policy.
We have no influence on possible data collection by the stores.  
4 Data collection by us  
We only use information about you to the extent that this is necessary for
downloading the app to your device. If necessary, we collect information from
whichever source (banners, store, etc.) you used to download the app.

In order to use our app, we create a username and a password for you, and
present this information on your mobile device. This individualized access is
necessary to connect to our game servers. The data will be created
automatically by our system and can be customized by you later with an e-mail
address and password of your choosing. Alternatively, you can use an existing
user account for the app.

In principle, you can access our app offers without disclosing any personal
information to us. It is always your choice whether or not to provide us with
your personal information.  
We collect information from you in order to fulfill the user contract
concluded with you. To this end, in addition to monitoring compliance with the
conditions of use and game rules, we monitor in particular the proper handling
of any payment order you have initiated.

If you register within our apps, participate in sweepstakes or subscribe to
our newsletter, we require personal data. This information includes, for
example, your name, address, email address, and other personal information
that Goodgame Studios may inquire into in individual cases. In many cases, use
of Goodgame Studios’ services is possible using a pseudonym. Users are
encouraged to make use of this possibility.

For statistical purposes, your mobile device and its associated operating
system are recorded by us. Beyond the purposes of pursuing unauthorized use of
our services, we analyze this data only for statistical and service
development. To the fullest extent possible, the information is anonymized.  
5 Access permissions for our apps  
Our apps require different access permissions on your device. These are
required to guarantee certain functionality of our apps. If you want, for
example, to create a profile picture from within the app, we need access to
your camera or photo album. If you want to buy additional content through the
app, we may need access to the necessary interface to your app store account.
Another example is so-called "push notifications", in which we can use an
interface to display a message directly on your end device.

The access permissions on your mobile device are dependent on the operating
system (e.g. Android, iOS, etc.) and the store where the app was purchased
(e.g. Google Play Store, Apple App Store, Amazon, etc.). You generally receive
information on which access permissions are required by our apps prior to
installation.

In Apple iOS, see "Settings" at any time for an overview of what content our
apps can access. You can restrict these access permissions at a later time.

In Android, various access permissions are also needed on your mobile device.
Under "Settings / Apps", you can review the access permissions of our apps.  
6 Data analysis by Goodgame Studios  
We also perform analyses on the behavior of users of our services, in order to
derive approaches for service optimization. These evaluations are conducted
with a pseudonym, in accordance with § 15 para. 3 German Telemedia Act (TMG),
i.e. the user name and other identifying characteristics are replaced by a
random character for the purpose, making the determination of a specific
natural person impossible or significantly more difficult.

Within our apps, we do not use any proprietary marketing or advertising
cookies. Instead, we use cookies on your device that can store your user name
and the current games settings in a text file. These cookies are necessary for
the provision of our apps.  
7 Tune Mobile App Tracking  
Our app is analyzed with technologies of Tune Inc. (2220 Western Ave.,
Seattle, WA, USA). To this end, various session and interaction data from you
are collected and stored. We need this information to improve the content and
usability of our games and to optimize the user experience for you. The
session and interaction data are at no time processed in personalized form,
rather under a pseudonym. For more information on data processing by TUNE
Inc., please refer to the respective privacy policy of that provider:
http://www.mobileapptracking.com/privacy-policy/.

You may at any time opt out of tracking by TUNE Inc. with future effect:
http://www.optoutmobile.com/optout/index.html.  
8 Facebook  
Facebook SDK: Within our app, we use the Software Development Kit (SDK) from
Facebook. The Facebook SDK is issued and administered by Facebook Inc, 1601 S.
California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. By means of this integration, we can
link various Facebook services with our app. For example, users can use the
Facebook SDK to share contents of our apps on their own Facebook timeline, or
to send messages to other Facebook users. Further information about Facebook
SDK within iOS can be found here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios.
For Android, please refer to: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android.

Facebook Login via the SDK: In order to use Facebook services within our apps,
you will need to first use Facebook Login to connect with Facebook. This
requires that you have an existing Facebook account or that you create a
Facebook account. If you want to use your Facebook account to log in to our
services, you will be guided directly in a first step to Facebook, where
Facebook will ask you to sign in or register. In no event will we learn your
personal login information (username and password). In a second step, you can
link your Facebook profile with each service you want to register to use. You
will then receive a separate notice detailing which data is transferred to us
from your Facebook profile. This generally includes your "public information"
on Facebook and anything you make public or make accessible to the respective
application. This generally includes your name, your profile and cover
picture, your gender, your networks, your username (Facebook URL) and your
user identifier (Facebook ID). In order to communicate with you without going
through Facebook, we also use the e-mail address you have registered with
Facebook.

You can check and modify the status of your connection to Facebook and the
respective access privileges of our apps at any time under your Facebook
profile settings (https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications). Here,
you will also find an overview of which information in your profile is public.
If you want to cancel the connection between Facebook and our apps, please log
in to Facebook and make the necessary changes in your profile settings. We
will then no longer be able to access information from your Facebook profile
in order to serve you.

Facebook App Events: We use the Facebook SDK service called "Facebook App
Events" to evaluate the reach of our advertising campaigns and use of Facebook
SDK. Facebook merely provides us with an aggregated analysis of user behavior
with our app. We also have no influence on the information that will be
processed by Facebook App Events.

In our app settings, you can opt out of using App Events for the given
purposes.  
9 Use of your data  
We use your personal information as needed in order to design and continually
improve our services.

We also use your personal information for establishing, implementing and
managing your user relationship with Goodgame Studios and processing payments.

In addition, we use your information to communicate with you. This includes
that we will, where appropriate, inform about news in our services via e-mail.
We may use your data to keep you regularly informed about products, services
and certain events from our range of services that might be of interest to
you. In any such communication, you will find a link labeled 'To unsubscribe
from future e-mails for this game account, please click here'. By clicking on
'here', you will receive no further information relating to the respective
game account.

Finally, we use your data in order to protect our web pages and to trace
unauthorized access.  
10 Disclosure of data  
Of course, your personal data will not be sold to third parties. Goodgame
Studios submits personal data received from you to third parties exclusively
to the following extent:

We work together with payment providers (e.g. credit card companies, banks,
PayPal, mobile services, debt collection agencies, etc.), service providers
that prepare and compile statistical data, IT service providers (e.g. data
centers, hosts, backup services, database services) together. These service
providers only have access to your personal data to the extent necessary to
fulfill their tasks. These service providers are obliged to treat your
personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the relevant
data protection laws.

In the event that Goodgame Studios, any companies owned by Goodgame Studios,
individual subsidiary/affiliated companies or parts of companies are sold,
your customer information will generally be passed on with the transmitted
part of the company. Your data is of course also subject – in such case – to
this Privacy Policy and the relevant data protection laws.  
11 Further notes on data protection  
Please note that all information voluntarily published by you (e.g. in chat
areas, in forums, in comments or by e-mail) can be collected and used by
others.

For reasons of own liability, we reserve the right to check these contents.
Furthermore, we strive to test for and prevent fraud (e.g. illegal game-fixing
at the expense of Goodgame) by means of independent testing and prevention
measures.  
12 Changing or deletion of data  
As a registered user you can review, update, correct or delete your personal
data in your profile settings or by contacting us at:
https://support.goodgamestudios.com/.

Goodgame Studios will delete personal data upon request, unless mandatory
obligations contradict such a deletion.  
13 Data security  
We process information collected from you according to German data protection
law. All employees are obliged to maintain data confidentiality and privacy
practices, and are trained in this regard.

For payment transactions, your information is encrypted using the SSL process.
Our SSL transfer is GoDaddy certified.
