<h2>8. CONSENT TO USE OF ELECTRONIC SERVICE PROVIDERS</h2>
<p> In order to play real money games on the Services, You will be required to send  money to and receive money from Us. We may use third-party electronic payment  processors and/or financial institutions ('ESPs') to process such financial  transactions. By accepting this Privacy Policy, You expressly consent to  Personal Information necessary for the processing of transactions being shared  with ESPs, including, where necessary, the transfer of information outside of  Your country. We take steps to ensure that Our arrangements with ESPs protect Your privacy. </p>
<h2>9. CONSENT TO SECURITY REVIEW</h2>
<p> We reserve the right to conduct a security review at any time to validate Your  identity, age, the registration data provided by You and to verify Your use of  the Services and Your financial transactions for potential breach of Our <a href="/en/general-information/legal-matters/general-terms-and-conditions">Terms and  Conditions of Use</a> and of applicable law. By accepting Our <a href="/en/general-information/legal-matters/general-terms-and-conditions">Terms and  Conditions of Use</a> You authorise Us, Our staff, agents and suppliers to use Your  Personal Information and to disclose Your Personal Information to third parties  for the purposes of validating the information You provide to Us in the course  of using the Services, including, where necessary, the transfer of information  outside of Your country. Security reviews may include but are not limited to  ordering a credit report and/or otherwise verifying the information You provide  against third-party databases. In addition, to facilitate these security  reviews, You agree to provide such information or documentation as We may  request. </p>
<h2>10. CONSENT TO USE OF ANTI-CHEATING SOFTWARE</h2>
<p> Our software package - used to access and use the Services - contains certain  features designed to detect use of automated programs that enable artificial  (non-human) intelligence to play on Our site. Use of such 'bot' software  programs violates Our <a href="/en/general-information/legal-matters/general-terms-and-conditions">Terms and  Conditions of Use</a>, where We deem it detrimental to other players. By installing Our  software and using the Services, You consent to Our software performing the  functions described in this section. Our software may perform any or all of the  following functions in order to detect the use of illicit automated programs  and ensure that We maintain a 'cheat free' environment for all users: (1) scan  Your list of active software applications while You are using the Services; (2)  scan Your list of active processes while You are using the Services; and (3)  scan the files in Your Services and site-related program folders to ensure that  only 'non-hacked' versions of Our software are being used. If any of the  foregoing processes reveals a suspect application or process, Our software may  scan the files associated with the suspect application or process and compile a  composite mesh (i.e., a profile that characterizes the files associated with  the application or process) to be matched against profiles for known illicit  automated programs. Our software will not perform any random search of large  portions of Your hard drive, equipment or files, and it will not transmit any  information to Us or to any third party other than the information necessary to  identify use of illicit automated programs as described above. Our software  will not alter any files or information on Your computer or other equipment and  will not interfere with the operation of any of Your applications. You may  terminate use of Our software at any time by uninstalling Our software package.</p>
<h2>11. SECURITY</h2>
<p> We understand the importance of information security and the techniques needed  to secure information. We store all of the Personal Information We receive  directly from You in a password-protected database residing within Our secure  network behind active state-of-the-art firewall software. Our Services support  SSL Version 3 with 128-bit encryption. We take steps to ensure Our  subsidiaries, agents, affiliates and suppliers also employ adequate levels of  security. </p>
<h2>12. PROTECTION OF CHILDREN</h2>
<p> The Services are not intended for or directed at persons under the age of  eighteen (18) (or the lawful age in their respective jurisdiction). Any person  who provides their information to Us through any part of the Services  represents to Us that they are eighteen (18) years of age (or the lawful age in  their respective jurisdiction) or older. It is Our policy to uncover attempts  by minors to access Our Services which may involve Us having to access and  verify Your Personal Information. If We become aware that a minor has attempted  to or has submitted personal information via the Services, We will not accept  this information and will take steps to remove such information from Our  records. </p>
<h2>13. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h2>
<p> Personal Information collected on the Services may be stored and processed in  any country in which We or Our affiliates, suppliers, ESPs or agents maintain  facilities. By using the Services, You expressly consent to any transfer of  information outside of Your country (including to third countries that may not  have been assessed as having adequate privacy laws). Nevertheless, We take  steps to ensure that Our agents, affiliates and suppliers comply with Our  standards of privacy regardless of their location.</p>
<h2>14. THIRD-PARTY PRACTICES</h2>
<p> We cannot ensure the protection of any information or images that You provide  to a third-party online site that links to or from the Services or any  information collected by any third party administering Our affiliate program  (if applicable) or any other program, since these third-party online sites are  owned and operated independently of Us. Any information collected by these  third parties is not governed by this Privacy Policy but by the privacy policy,  if any, of such third party. If You have questions about a third party's  information practices, please read its privacy policy. We assume no  responsibility or liability whatsoever for the practices, actions or policies  of such third parties, and We are not responsible for the content or privacy  practices of such online sites.</p>
<h2>15. LEGAL DISCLAIMER</h2>
<p> The Services operate 'AS-IS' and 'AS-AVAILABLE,' without liability of any kind.  We are not responsible for events beyond Our direct control. Because of the  complex and constantly changing nature of Our technology and business, We  cannot guarantee nor do We represent that there will be error-free performance  regarding the privacy of Your Personal Information, and We will not be liable  for any indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to the  use or release of Personal Information.</p>
<h2>16. MERGERS AND OTHER EVENTS REQUIRING TRANSFER</h2>
<p> If We should ever file for bankruptcy, or become insolvent, or be acquired by a  third party, merge with a third party, sell all or part of Our assets, or  transfer substantially all or part of Our relevant assets to a third party, We  are entitled to share the Personal Information and all other information You  have provided through the Services to potential and subsequent business and  merger partners. By agreeing to the standard Terms and Conditions of Use, you  hereby give your consent to such transfer of this information.</p>
<h2>17. CONSENT TO PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

This is Our entire and exclusive  Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. This Privacy Policy  should be read in conjunction with Our <a href="/en/general-information/legal-matters/general-terms-and-conditions">Terms and  Conditions of Use</a> and any additional applicable terms posted on Our Platforms. We  may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy and will notify You of  these changes by posting the modified terms on Our Platforms.
