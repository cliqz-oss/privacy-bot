However, Viumbe attempts to limit access to the Service information by third party search engine "crawlers", "robots" or "spiders". Viumbe takes action to block access of these engines to personal information on the Service, beyond users’ name, profile picture, and limited aggregated data about users’ profile. Nevertheless, after being uploaded to the Service, such Content is not private or confidential and you should not have any expectation of privacy with respect to it.

In such cases the amendments will become effective immediately upon their initial posting, or as required.
