Our Privacy Policy
==================

This privacy policy sets out how SitePoint Pty Ltd (ACN 089 647 638) (“we/SitePoint”) treats the privacy of customers and others with whom we interact.

In this privacy policy, the term “personal information” includes information about an identifiable individual, including names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, “bio” information, credit and banking details and if and where applicable, includes information that constitutes “sensitive information”.

**1. Collection and Storage of Personal Information and Data**

We may collect personal information about individuals. Our usual approach is to collect personal information directly from the individual concerned. This information could include name, email, telephone or address contact details and financial details. In most circumstances we do not collect sensitive information.

For example, we collect personal information in circumstances including:

(i) upon your registration on our website;

(ii) when products or services are ordered;

(iii) when paying for products or services and when processing returns or exchanges;

(iv) when you telephone us or visit our website and make an enquiry to which a later response is requested and to do so requires your contact details;

(v) when you ask to be included on marketing distribution lists or interact with us through our social media services or third party social media services that are connected to our site; and

(vi) when evaluating job applicants and personnel, including their contact details, employment history and educational qualifications. This may include “sensitive information” as defined in the Privacy Act (1988) (Cth).

Further details about our privacy policy and practices for job applicants will be available at the time of application.

We may use ‘cookies’ to collect data (typically not personal information) relating to your general internet usage. This data may include IP-addresses, browser versions, number of visits and similar such data relating to your navigation of the internet including to and from our site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more tailored service, for instance by storing information about your preferences and allowing us to recognise you when you return to our site.

You may refuse to accept cookies by activating settings on your internet browser. However, please note that if you select such settings your may be unable to access certain parts of our site.

When individuals use our mobile application, we also collect information about your city location, device model and version and operating system version. (This is typically not considered “personal information”).
We hold personal information in our own secure databases, and, to some extent, for marketing purposes in the databases of third parties engaged by us (subject to obligations regarding privacy and confidentiality) to conduct electronic direct marketing subject to all legislative requirements.

**2. Anonymity / pseudonymity**

Where practicable, customers and others have the right to interact with us anonymously or using a pseudonym. Circumstances where it is not practicable, however, include where personal information is required to complete a credit card or account transaction.

**3. Use of Personal Information**

We may use personal information for the purpose of marketing but only where such use complies with applicable privacy laws.

We use the personal information collected from you for the purpose it was provided or collected, including in the following ways:

(a) To respond to enquiries received from you;

(b) To process, confirm, fulfil and update you about your orders and to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts and agreements entered into between you and us.

(c) To perform authorised financial transactions with you;

(d) To verify your identity and to assist you if you have forgotten any user name or password;

(e) To communicate with you and provide you with information (whether by email, post or other means) about our products or services, where you have requested or consented to receiving this from us or where this provision is otherwise permitted under applicable privacy law;

(f) To notify you about changes to our goods and services;

(g) To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer/ device;

(h) To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so;

(i) To enable you to enter competitions we run;

(j) To facilitate your participation in surveys we (or a third party on our behalf) run where you volunteer that personal information;

(k) To enable you to participate in any loyalty or reward programs we may run, if you so request it;

(l) To receive and address feedback or complaints from you; and

(m) To protect our legal interests and fulfil our regulatory obligations (if and to the extent necessary).

All SitePoint customers and others with whom we interact have the option to opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us. If you do not wish to continue to receive electronic marketing communications from us and/or selected third parties you should opt-out by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in any email communications that we might send you.

**4. Disclosure of Personal Information**
We may disclose your personal information to any of our related group companies and their personnel, including in the USA. They will only use it for the same purposes that we may under this policy. We may provide personal information to third parties outside our group companies for limited purposes, such as to help us in providing goods and services to customers.

Those persons and business may include:

(a) Organisations who carry out credit, fraud and other security checks;

(b) Our online payment service providers, for the purpose of facilitating payments;

(c) Third party providers who fulfil and deliver orders;

(d) Third party software providers who store details of customer account for us or who provide other IT services in connection with the operation of our business; and

(e) Marketing businesses engaged by us to disseminate materials to which recipients have consented.

We may also disclose your personal information to third parties outside our group of companies:

(a) Where we have your express permission to do so;

(b) Where it can reasonably be inferred from the circumstances that you consent to the disclosure to the third parties;

(c) If SitePoint or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal information which we hold about our customers may be one of the transferred assets (subject to the same constraints on use and disclosure as under this policy); and

(d) If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of SitePoint, its personnel or customers . This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

We limit the information we provide to third parties to the information they need to help us provide or facilitate the provision of goods and services to you and otherwise operate our business. We deal with third parties that are required to meet the privacy standards required by law and/or contract in handling your personal information, and use your personal information only for the purposes that we gave it to them.

We may disclose personal information overseas as noted above and also to employee support personnel and content managers located in Greece and the UK as well as contractor-editors in Germany, Canada and Croatia. We will disclose it only for purposes set out in this policy.

**5. Security of personal information**

We take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information, including internal and external security, restricting access to personal information to those who have a need to know, maintain technological products to prevent unauthorised computer access and regularly reviewing our technology to maintain security.
We treat website and credit card security seriously and endeavour to provide a secure, safe platform through which to conduct transactions.
