DaWanda is a marketplace for unique products.  
Protecting your privacy is important to us. We collect and use all data only
in accordance with legal requirements.  
This data protection statement tells you how we collect, process and use your
personal data. The data protection statement also contains information on the
content and scope of any agreement you give us pertaining to DaWanda’s use of
your personal data. The data protection statement is to be considered an
addition to the General Terms and Conditions of DaWanda GmbH.  
  
  
1\. Responsible body, area of application  
The responsible body is  
  
DaWanda GmbH (hereinafter also referred to as “DaWanda” or “we”/“us”),  
Windscheidstraße 18,  
10627 Berlin,  
represented by its CEOs Claudia Helming, Niels Nüssler.  
  
You can find more information about us in the Imprint. If you have any queries
about data protection, you can contact us via email at [email protected]  
  
This data protection statement describes the collection and use of personal
data when you visit and use the services offered by DaWanda. It also applies
to complementary offerings by DaWanda (e.g. use of the DaWanda app, purchase
of goods or vouchers sold by DaWanda, games or competitions). For special
areas or services (e.g. featured items, communities, groups) additional data
protection information can be found in the FAQs in question or under the
heading “Questions and answers”, as well as in the explanations or conditions
attached to the service in question. By agreeing to this data protection
statement, you declare that you agree that DaWanda may use your data
accordingly.  
  
In addition, the data protection conditions of external services or social
networks (e.g. facebook, Google+, Pinterest, Twitter) that you can use while
visiting DaWanda apply.  
  
  
2\. Collection and Use of Data Without Registration  
You can use DaWanda without providing us with personal data. When you access
our websites, communication-related details (e.g. IP address) or usage-related
details (e.g. content viewed) are generated automatically by technical means
to ensure that you can use the content as you wish. This data is stored and
used by us without a specific personal link (e.g. by anonymisation of the IP
address) in order to obtain technical or statistical information for
troubleshooting or to improve our website, or for research and analysis
purposes.  
  
  
3\. Use of Personal Data when Using DaWanda  
DIn order to be able to offer you our services, we need various types of data:  
When you register, we collect you basic data (member name, first name and
surname, email address, password). Your member name allows you to use a
pseudonym when dealing with third parties through our Internet platform. Once
you decide to place an order with DaWanda, we will also collect your invoice
address and delivery address. If you would like to sell products via DaWanda,
we will also collect your full address, your shop and company name, your
seller status (commercial or private), your T&amp;Cs; (including information
on the right of withdrawal, etc., where applicable) and Imprint, as well as
your bank details and other payment information.  
For individual offers on DaWanda, the appropriate usage and transaction data
will be collected (buying, selling, offers and content).  
Furthermore, registered members can voluntarily supply optional data (e.g.
shop description, “About me” profile description, personal interests or
preferences, photos (e.g. profile picture), date of birth and other
biographical data, settings for notifications or newsletters, recommended or
wishlist products, messages, guestbook or blog entries, forum posts, ratings,
comments, answers to surveys, etc.). Please note that the data that you add
under “About me” on your profile can be viewed by other members and visitors.
For example, you can embed an RSS feed or display your facebook feed. You can
change or remove this voluntary information at any time. All data you enter
for the purposes of advertising your goods or services are naturally visible
to other members and visitors to the site.  
We use your personal details (basic data, usage and transaction data, optional
data) for DaWanda to provide you and other members with a marketplace for
great products and a community to exchange ideas and get inspiration. For this
reason, we use your personal data to, among other things:  

  * find out who you and other members are,
  

  * provide and personalise the services you use, e.g. to allow you to conclude a contract via DaWanda, to allow payments (e.g. with PayPal), to calculate or debit fees, to order and redeem DaWanda vouchers, to use the rating system, to answer your queries or to inform you about specific events, 
  

  * to give you an overview of your profile and your activities under “My DaWanda” (e.g. messages, purchases, wishlists, favourite shops, events, seminars, products you've added a “heart” to) and to allow you to be active in communities or groups,
  

  * to allow you to communicate with other members (e.g. via messages, sending a “heart”) or third parties (e.g. via recommendations, comments),
  

  * to allow other members to receive information about you (e.g. under “About me”), and,
  

  * to allow us to prevent and combat illegal or impermissible activities. 
  

  * We will also only use your email address for those purposes for which you have provided it (e.g. membership-related messages, sending status emails, notifications regarding purchases and sales, new messages or comments). You will only receive advertising from us via email if you have agreed to do so or where the law otherwise allows. You can view and change your settings for notifications and newsletters under “My profile”.

  
We do not pass personal data to third parties unless you have previously
agreed to this or it is legally permissible for us to do so. We do pass
personal information to other members of DaWanda, such as contractual partners
as part of a purchase (e.g. contact information, postal address, payment
information and details). Data of this kind pertaining to other members may
only be used for necessary communication in relation to DaWanda (e.g. a
purchase or perhaps a complaint). In particular, you may not use the data of
other members for advertising purposes, unless the member in question has
expressly agreed to such use. Furthermore, members are obliged to observe all
specifications pertaining to data protection, in particular the Federal Data
Protection Act. If a member provides his or her personal data to another
member, we are not generally capable of guaranteeing continued protection of
said data. For this reason, please make sure beforehand that the member in
question is trustworthy and ask yourself whether he/she really needs your
personal data before you communicate it.  
Data can be passed on to contractors hired and supervised by us to provide
technical services (e.g. hosting, maintenance) or to support us otherwise
(e.g. debt collection, customer service). Naturally, we follow all data
protection obligations and require our partners to do likewise.  
DaWanda is required to pass personal data and/or usage data to investigative,
judiciary and regulatory authorities if and as far as is necessary to defend
against threats posed to public safety and to investigate crimes in accordance
with legal requirements.  
To guard our rightful interests, we may obtain credit checks about you (in
Germany, for example, from SCHUFA Holding AG in Wiesbaden) and/or have your
personal data verified via a credit card company. We also retain the right to
ask you for a bank enquiry or guarantee or to ask you to provide us with your
credit card data and security via a credit card before you can offer or
procure high-priced goods/services via DaWanda. Your protectable interests
will be taken into account in accordance with legal requirements.  
  
  
4\. Data storage in conjunction with customer relationship management systems  
We work with a supplier of customer relationship management (CRM) systems in
Germany, who provides us with services. The service provider processes
customer data (names, e-mail addresses and address data of our members, as
well as sales data) on our behalf only. No data is transmitted to countries
outside of the EU.  
  
  
5\. Cookies Unrelated to Online Advertising  
When you visit our websites, we place information on your computer in the form
of a cookie, which is recognised automatically the next time you visit. A
cookie is a short piece of information in text form that is transmitted as a
Hypertext Transfer Protocol header. The cookie is either sent from the web
server to the browser or generated by scripting (such as JavaScript). Cookies
allow us, for example, to adapt a website to meet your interests. If you do
not wish us to recognise your computer again later, please set your web
browser to delete cookies from your computer, to block all cookies or to warn
you before saving a cookie. However, you may not be able to avail of the full
scope of DaWanda functions.  
  
DaWanda uses the following cookies (unrelated to online advertising):  
  
a) Session cookies (e.g. for account access security) or functional cookies
(e.g. to preserve the functionality of navigational elements, for help texts,
AB tests);  
  
b) Language or regional settings cookies (DaWanda uses these to store the
country, currency or language settings with which DaWanda’s websites should be
displayed).  
  
  
6\. facebook  
On our platform we use the services of the American web network facebook
(facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA). For
example, we have installed the facebook "Like" button (a plug-in). This means
that we have implemented the "Like" button in our website using a programming
code supplied by facebook. The plug-ins can be recognised by their use of one
of facebook’s logos (a white “f” on a blue tile or a “thumbs up” icon). The
list and appearance of facebook’s social plug-ins can be viewed on facebook’s
site:  
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins  
You can use the “Like” button to show facebook friends and other facebook
users which items you like/recommend. Depending on your settings, this may
happen automatically, i.e., items that you place on a DaWanda wishlist are
displayed on facebook (automatic sharing).  
As soon as you call up the page, data will be transmitted to facebook,
regardless of whether you click the button or not. If you click the “Like”
button, facebook will also receive the information that you enjoyed a certain
piece of content. The content of the plug-in is transmitted from facebook
directly to the user’s browser and back. DaWanda has no control over the scope
of the data collected by facebook via this plug-in and for that reason can
only provide you with the information known to DaWanda:  
The inclusion of the plug-in means that facebook is told that you have called
up a certain page of DaWanda’s website. If you are logged into facebook at the
same time, you can be identified (e.g. for the purposes of advertising on
facebook). If, for example, you press the “Like” button or post a comment,
this information is transmitted from the browser directly to facebook and is
stored there. If you do not use facebook, the service can still, at a minimum,
collect and save your IP address. The purpose and scope of data collection and
the further processing and use of data by facebook, as well as the applicable
user rights and setting options to protect a user’s privacy can be found in
facebook’s data protection policy:  
https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy  
If you are a member of facebook but do not want facebook to collect
information about your visit to DaWanda’s site and to link this information to
your facebook account, you must log out of facebook before visiting DaWanda.  
If you are not a facebook member and/or have not (yet) agreed to data
collection and use by facebook, DaWanda recommends that you not click on
facebook plug-ins.  
  
Furthermore, DaWanda offers the option “Log in with facebook”, which allows
you to register and log into DaWanda using your facebook access data. If you
do so, DaWanda will receive information from facebook on your public profile
(e.g. name, profile picture, age range, sex, language, country) as well as
your friends list and email address. You can also allow further exchanges of
information between DaWanda and facebook (e.g. by means of automatic sharing,
see above). Even if you have a DaWanda profile, you can use this method to
link it to your facebook profile in order to making logging in easier. DaWanda
never posts on your facebook wall or passes on your personal data to facebook
or third parties without your permission. The administration of your DaWanda
member account and your facebook profile is under your control.  
  
We assume that your protect your facebook access data as well as you do your
DaWanda password. We do not receive the password that you use to log in to
facebook as it is encrypted.  
  
  
  
7\. Other Plug-ins and External Services  
DaWanda’s websites may contain other plug-ins. The plug-in is the
responsibility of the provider in question (e.g. Google+, Pinterest, Twitter).
The plug-ins installed are marked with the relevant logo, e.g. a Google or
Twitter logo.  
A visit to the DaWanda websites may execute these plug-ins. This can mean that
information about your visit (particularly the IP address) is forwarded to the
plug-in provider and stored by said provider. If you are registered with one
of them, and logged in, your visit to DaWanda’s websites can be assigned to
your account. If you click on the plug-in, third parties can see this. This
information is also sent directly to the plug-in provider and stored there.
You can prevent being identified by logging out of the account you hold with
the plug-in provider – and, if necessary, deleting the cookies – before you
visit the DaWanda websites.  
DaWanda cannot control the scope of the data that each provider collects using
the plug-in, or how it uses it. DaWanda would like to refer you to the data
protection provisions of the provider in question, if there are any. Often,
the provider offers settings to allow users to decide how of their data should
be handled. We recommend that you find out about the type, scope and purpose
of the collection and use of personal data directly from the provider, as well
as about any processing of data that may take place outside the EU:  
\- Google+  
This social network is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,
Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. The Google+ button can be identified by the “+1″
icon. You can see the Google+ data protection policy here:  
https://developers.google.com/+/web/buttons-policy  
\- Twitter  
Twitter is a microblogging service offered by the American company Twitter,
Inc. (795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107). You can see the
Twitter data protection policy here:  
https://twitter.com/privacy  
\- Pinterest  
Pinterest is a social network of Pinterest, Inc., 808 Brannan St, San
Francisco, CA 94103, USA. You can see the Pinterest data protection policy
here:  
https://about.pinterest.com/de/privacy-policy  
\- AddThis  
AddThis is a bookmarking service that allows simply bookmarking. AddThis is
based in the USA: 1595 Spring Hill Road, Vienna, VA2218. Here is the AddThis
data protection policy:  
https://www.addthis.com/privacy/privacy-policy  
DaWanda recommends that users who are not customers of a plug-in provider or
of an external service linked via a plug-in, or who have not agreed to data
collection and use by such services, do not use or click on such plug-ins.  
  
  
  
8\. Google Analytics  
DaWanda works with Google Analytics: Google Analytics is a web analysis
service from Google Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files
that are stored on your computer and which allow your use of the website to be
analysed. The information generated by the cookie regarding your use of this
website is generally transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the
United States. IP anonymisation has been activated on DaWanda’s websites,
meaning that the IP addresses of Google users within European Union member
states or in other states that are party to the EEA Agreement are truncated
before being communicated. Only in exceptional circumstances is the full IP
address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. On
behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to
evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports about activity on the
website for the site owner and to provide additional services connected to
website use and internet use. The IP address transmitted by your browser
through Google Analytics is not merged with other data by Google. You can
prevent the storage of cookies by means of a browser software setting;
however, if you do so, you may not be able to use all the functions of this
website. Furthermore, you can prevent the recording of the data generated by
the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address)
by Google as well as the processing of this data by installing the browser
plug available at the following link:  
The current link is: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de  
  
  
  
  
9\. Consent to the use of Google Remarketing  
You agree to the use of DaWanda Google Remarketing  
Google Remarketing is a service for interest-based ads. The Remarketing Tag
sets cookies for pages of the website for the visitor (eg. for certain
products that a viewed or clicked on), which are later used for advertisements
on websites by third-party vendors, including Google. Visitors can disable the
use of cookies by Google in their Ads Settings:
https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662856?hl=en  
Alternatively, visitors can disable the use of cookies by third parties by
accessing the deactivation page of the Network Advertising Initiative:
https://www.networkadvertising.org/  
  
  
10\. Agreement to the Use of Data for Purposes of DaWanda’s Own Advertising or
Market Research  
You agree that we can collect, process and use your personal data for our own
advertising or market research purposes, but in particular for needs-led
design of the goods and services offered by us and third parties on DaWanda’s
websites. We can collect, collate and use your data, along with that of other
members, in anonymised form in order to improve our services, pages and
advertisements.  
  
  
11\. Agreement to Receive Marketing Emails and the DaWanda Newsletter  
If you agree to the receipt of marketing emails or newsletters (e.g. when you
register or during a later log-in), you thereby agree to receive the DaWanda
Newsletter containing content chosen by us, or emails with advertising, at the
email address that you have supplied to us. DaWanda newsletters or marketing
emails may appear at regular or irregular intervals and, in addition to
information pertaining to DaWanda, may contain offers from DaWanda members or
third parties.  
You can unsubscribe to marketing emails and newsletters at any time under My
DaWanda or via a link in the email in question.  
  
  
12\. Agreement to the Use of Product Feeds  
You declare that you agree that we pass your sales information (e.g. shop
name, data, pictures and stars for products offered) to third parties (e.g.
affiliate networks, affiliate partners, platforms) to ensure that your offers
are advertised there and can be presented to potential customers.  
You can refuse the use of your sales information at any time in My DaWanda
under “Edit shop – Partner pages”.  
  
  
  
13\. Agreement to Targeted Advertisement Insertions and the Use of Tracking
Cookies for Advertising Purposes  
During the use of DaWanda websites, cookies or code snippets related to online
advertising are placed on users’ computers (see the information on cookies in
general and/or those unrelated to advertising at number 5 above), or the user
can be identified by means of his/her log-in. DaWanda records information
regarding your activities on DaWanda websites (e.g. surfing behaviour, items
you have looked at or placed on a wishlist, links you have clicked on). We
would like to use this information to make your experience of DaWanda more
pleasant or to show or inform you of items, offers, promotions or advertising
that may interest you.  
DaWanda places its own ads or works with external partners to place and
optimise its own or third parties advertisements. These external partners may
place a cookie on your computer, for example if you visit DaWanda websites;
however, no personal data such as name, address or date of birth will be
collected, stored or transmitted. Recording of complete IP addresses is also
prevented. Below you will find the most important external partners used by
DaWanda, together with their data protection information and the options they
offer to refuse usage-based advertising and deactivate the associated data
collection. You can also delete the cookies from your browser at any time and
so prevent future advertising based on them.

You hereby agree that we may show targeted advertising (e.g. on our website or
in the DaWanda app) and place an associated tracking or partner cookie or code
snippet – or allow a third party to do so – that allows targeted advertising
to be shown, for example advertising relevant to your age group, your location
or to products that you have looked at, recommended, bought or sold (this is
known as remarketing, retargeting or behavioural advertising). However, if you
see advertising of this sort, it does not mean that we have provided the
advertising parties with personal data such as your name, address and date of
birth; IP addresses are truncated.  
  
  
14\. Agreement to the Use of Google AdSense  
You hereby agree to the use of Google AdSense by DaWanda.  
AdSense is a service used to integrated advertisements from Google. Google
AdSense uses cookies, which are text files stored on your computer and used to
analyse your use of the website. Google AdSense also uses web beacons, as they
are known (invisible graphics). These web beacons can be used to evaluate
information such as the traffic on these pages.  
The information generated by the cookies and web beacons regarding your use of
this website (including the IP address of the member) and the delivery of
advertising formats is transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the
USA. This information can be passed on by Google to its own contractual
partners. Google will not, however, merge your IP address with other data it
has stored about you.  
You can prevent the installation of cookies by means of a browser software
setting; however, if you do so, you may not then be able to use all the
functions of this website. Individual settings can also be made, and Google
advertising can be deactivated, at www.google.com/settings/ads. The use of
cookies by third-party providers can also be prevented if you call up the
deactivation page of the Network Advertising Initiative
(www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).  
You can find more information on the issue of data protection on Google here:

15\. DaWanda App  
15.1. Use of the DaWanda App, App Permissions  
The DaWanda app is another means of accessing the DaWanda platform. For this
reason, we treat your information there in the same way as if you were
accessing the DaWanda website. This applies, for example, to the use of your
data, cookies, plug-ins or Google Analytics.  
  
If you use the app, DaWanda can also access your app-related data such as
device name, device manufacturer, model, operating system, app or SDK version,
or use your system tools (e.g. to allow you to receive messages even when in
standby mode). This may be carried out by means of plug-ins (e.g. for the
facebook ID or by means of an access token if facebook is used). We will not
access data you have stored outside the app such as calendars, photos,
messages or similar without your permission.  
  
Particularities enumerated in section 14.2 f also apply to the DaWanda app.  
  
15.2. Use of Location Data by the DaWanda App  
The DaWanda app may use an anonymised or pseudonymised form of your location
data if you have approved this function on your device. We would like to use
this location information to make your experience of DaWanda more pleasant or
to show or inform you of items, offers, promotions or advertising that may
interest you. Personal data such as name, address or date of birth will not be
collected, stored or transmitted. Recording of complete IP addresses is also
prevented.  
  
With regard to location data, we work with the external partner named below;
there you will find additional data protection information and will be able to
refuse the use of your location data and to deactivate the collection thereof.  
Urban Airship Inc., 1417 NW Everett St, Suite 300, Portland OR 97209, USA:
https://urbanairship.com/legal/privacy-policy  
  
15.3. Agreement to Receive Push Messages Through the DaWanda App  
If you have issued approval on your mobile end device, the DaWanda app can
send you push messages, e.g. to keep you informed about us, system messages,
products (e.g. DaWanda Inspirations & Highlights), promotions, news or new
functionalities. You can configure or unsubscribe to the push messages at any
time in the settings of your mobile operating system.  
  
If you agree to the receipt of push messages (e.g. after you first log in via
the DaWanda app), you hereby agree to receive information and advertising
about DaWanda or DaWanda offers on your mobile end device.  
  
  
16\. Disclosure, Deletion and Blocking of Data  
You can view, edit and, if desired, delete your data and settings under “My
DaWanda”, and then under “My profile”. You can have your first name and
surname changed by our customer service department.  
  
Furthermore, DaWanda will disclose, free of charge, the data held on the
querying party, either electronically or in writing. Before we disclose such
information, we may require that documentation be provided to establish the
identity of the querying party.  
  
Blocking and deletion of data is carried out in accordance with legal
requirements.  
  
  
  
17\. Protection of Your Data, Security  
We use the usual standard security procedures, including encryption, passwords
and physical security to protect your personal data from unauthorised access
and disclosure and to prevent annoying communication (spam). The information
on your profile is stored on a secure server and protected by a firewall.  
  
  
18\. Revocation of Agreement, Refusal of Advertising, Market Research or
Opinion Polling  
If the use of personal data is based on your agreement, this agreement can be
revoked at any time; the revocation, however, will only apply to future use of
the data. You can revoke this agreement by an email to [email protected]
Revocation of your agreement may mean that certain services are no longer
available or that your usage relationship with DaWanda is ended. We retain the
right to place our data protection activities on a legal basis at any time.  
  
You can also refuse the use of your data for the purposes of advertising,
market research or opinion polling at any time – the simplest way to do so is
via an email to [email protected] Doing so will not incur any greater costs
than the transmission costs included in the basic tariffs. Every time we use
your data for these purposes, we will remind you of your right to refuse such
usage and/or provide you with a simple means of unsubscribing (e.g. a link).  
  
  
19\. Change  
As technology advances, we will also adapt our data protection statement. We
will add changes to this page in good time, and, if necessary, ask you for
fresh agreement.  
  
All the same, you should view this page on a regular basis in order to find
out about the current status of the data protection policy.
