About Our Privacy Policy
------------------------

Whenever you do something like buy one of our products, watch a show or download an app, information is created. Because we know your privacy is important, we have a Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use and protect that information. There’s a quick summary below, and the actual policy is written in [an easy to understand “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQ) format](/sites/privacy_policy/terms). We want to simplify this explanation, so you can make informed choices about your privacy, and then spend the rest of your time enjoying our products and services.

**Effective July 24, 2015**

A Quick Summary of Our Privacy Policy
-------------------------------------

Our Privacy Policy applies to your use of all products, services and websites offered by AT&T and our AT&T affiliates, such as DIRECTV, unless they have a different privacy policy. Because some apps, including some AT&T and DTV branded apps, require additional information, or use information in different ways, they may have their own privacy policies and/or terms and conditions. These apps may also offer you additional choices for managing your personal information.
