The disclaimers, exclusions, and limits stated in sections 19, 20, and 21 apply to the greatest extent allowed by law, but no more. We do not intend to deprive you of any mandatory protections provided to you by law. Because some jurisdictions may prohibit the disclaimer of some warranties, the exclusion of some damages, or other matters, one or more of the disclaimers, exclusions, or limits may not apply to you.

23. Loss Payment (aka Indemnification)

**23.1 *In General***. You will pay us for any loss of ours that is caused by (1) your access of the Website; (2) your conduct on the Website; (3) your breach of these terms; (4) your violation of rights of another person, including intellectual property and privacy rights; or (5) your negligent or intentional misconduct. But you are not required to pay if the loss was caused by our intentional misconduct.

**23.2 *Definitions***

**23.2(A)** “***Loss***” means an amount that we are legally responsible for or pay in any form. Amounts include, for example, a judgment, a settlement, a fine, damages, injunctive relief, staff compensation, a decrease in property value, and expenses for defending against a claim for a loss (including fees for legal counsel, expert witnesses, and other advisers). A loss can be tangible or intangible; can arise from bodily injury, property damage, or other causes; can be based on tort, breach of contract, or any other theory of recovery; and includes incidental, direct, and consequential damages.

**23.2(B)** A loss is “***caused by***” an event if the loss would not have happened without the event, even if the event is not a proximate cause of the loss.

**23.3 *Our Duty to Notify You***. If we have your contact information, we will notify you before the 30th day after we know or should reasonably have known of a claim for a loss that you might be compelled to pay. But our failure to give you timely notice does not end your obligation, except if that failure prejudices your ability to mitigate losses.

**23.4 *Legal Defense of a Claim***. We have control over defending a claim for a loss (including settling it), unless we direct you to control the defense. You and we will cooperate with each other in good faith on a claim.

**23.5 *No Exclusivity***. Our rights under this section do not affect other rights we might have.

24. Governing Law; Place for Resolving Disputes

**24.1** The laws of the British Virgin Islands—without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law—govern all matters arising out of (or relating to) the Website or these terms. The predominant purpose of these terms is providing services and licensing access to intellectual property and not a “sale of goods.”

**24.2** Except for disputes subject to arbitration, all disputes arising out of (or relating to) the Website or these terms will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts in the British Virgin Islands. Each party hereby submits to the personal jurisdiction of the courts in the British Virgin Islands to resolve all disputes not subject to arbitration. Each party hereby waives any right to seek another forum or venue because of improper or inconvenient forum.

**24.3** For purposes of this section, the Website will be deemed solely based in the British Virgin Islands and will be deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Glorious Holding Investment, either specific or general, in any other jurisdiction.

25. Dispute Resolution

**25.1 *In General***. Each party will allow the other a reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other has not met the duties under these terms. The parties will first meet and negotiate with each other in good faith to try to resolve all disputes between the parties arising out of (or relating to) the use of the Website.

**25.2 *Litigation Election***. Either party may elect to litigate the following type of case or controversy: (1) an action seeking equitable relief, or (2) a suit to compel compliance with this dispute resolution process.

**25.3 *Mediation***. If the parties cannot settle a dispute arising out of (or relating to) the Website or these terms through negotiation after 30 days, either party may, by notice to the other party and the BVI International Arbitration Centre, demand mediation under the British Virgin Islands Arbitration Act of 2013. Mediation will take place in Tortola, British Virgin Islands. The language of the mediation will be English. Each party will participate actively and constructively in mediation proceedings once started and will attend at least one joint meeting between the mediator and the parties. Any party may terminate mediation at any time after an initial discussion between the mediator and the parties. Each party will bear its own costs in mediation, and the parties will share equally between them all third-party mediation costs unless the parties agree differently in writing.

**25.4 *Arbitration***. If the parties cannot settle a dispute through mediation, the parties will settle any unresolved dispute arising out of (or relating to) the Website or these terms by arbitration under the British Virgin Islands Arbitration Act of 2013. A single arbitrator will preside over the arbitration and issue a final award on all issues submitted to arbitration. Arbitration will take place in Tortola, British Virgin Islands. The language of the arbitration will be English. The parties will bear equally the costs of arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, and each party will bear the costs associated with its case, subject to the arbitrator’s right to award costs and fees under these terms. The arbitrator will not award punitive or exemplary damages, or damages otherwise limited or excluded in these terms, and the arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding. Any court of competent jurisdiction may confirm and enforce the arbitrator’s award. Unless required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator will disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration under these terms without the advance written consent of both parties.

**25.5 *Right to Injunctive Relief***. Both parties acknowledge that remedies at law may be inadequate to provide an aggrieved party with full payment if the other party breaches these terms, and that an aggrieved party may seek injunctive relief if a breach happens, besides seeking all other remedies available at law or in equity.

**25.6 *Recovery of Expenses***. In any adversarial proceedings between the parties arising out of this agreement or relating to the subject matter of this agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover from the other party, besides any other relief awarded, all expenses that the prevailing party incurs in those proceedings, including legal fees and expenses. For purposes of this section, “***prevailing party***” means, for any adversarial proceeding, the party in whose favor an award is rendered, except that if in those proceedings the award finds in favor of one party on one or more claims or counterclaims and in favor of the other party on one or more other claims or counterclaims, neither party will be the prevailing party. If any proceedings are voluntarily dismissed or are dismissed as part of settlement of that dispute, neither party will be the prevailing party in those proceedings.

**25.7 *Waiver of Jury Trial***. Both parties hereby waive the right to a trial by jury for any dispute arising out of (or relating to) the Website or these terms. Either party may enforce this waiver up to and including the first day of trial.

**25.8 *Class Action Waiver***. The parties will conduct any proceedings to resolve a dispute in any forum on an individual basis only. Neither you nor we will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. The parties will not combine any arbitration or proceeding with another without the advanced written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.

**25.9 *Limitation on Time to File Disputes***. A party will not file a dispute arising out of (or relating to) the Website or these terms more than one year after the cause of action arose. Any dispute brought after one year is barred.

26. General Provisions

**26.1 *Entire Agreement***. These terms form the entire agreement between you and us about your access to the Website. It supersedes all earlier or contemporaneous terms between you and us about access to the Website. A printed version of these terms will be admissible in any proceedings arising out of (or relating to) these terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and kept in printed form.

**26.2 *Copy of these Terms***. You may—and we recommend that you—print these terms on your printer or save them to your computer. If you have trouble printing a copy, please contact us at <support@keezmovies.com> and we will email you a copy.

**26.3 *Changes***. We may change these terms on one or more occasions. We will try to post changes on the Website at least 15 days before they become effective. Changes will become effective on the “last updated” date stated at the top of the terms. <span>Changes will not apply to continuing disputes or to disputes arising out of (or relating to) events happening before the posted changes</span>. While we will try to notify you when we make changes to these terms, we do not assume an obligation to do so, and it is your responsibility to frequently check this webpage to review the most current terms. <span>By continuing to use the Website after we post changes to these terms, you agree to the revised terms</span>. If you do not agree to the revised terms, your exclusive remedy is to stop accessing the Website. If you need more information about the changes or have any other questions or comments about the changes, please contact us at <support@keezmovies.com>.

**26.4 *Assignment and Delegation***. We may assign any rights or delegate any obligations under these terms to an affiliate or third party. You will not assign your rights or delegate your obligations under these terms without our advanced written consent. Any attempted assignment or delegation in breach of this provision will be void.

**26.5 *No waiver***. If either party fails to require the other party to perform any provision of these terms, that failure does not prevent the party from later enforcing that provision. If either party waives the other’s breach of a provision, that waiver is not treated as waiving a later breach of the provision.

**26.6 *Severability***. If any part of these terms is for any reason held to be unenforceable, the rest of it remains fully enforceable if the essential provisions of these terms for each party remain valid.

**26.7 *Cumulative Remedies***.
