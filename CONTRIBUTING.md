# Contributing to 'Privacy Bot'

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! We are excited to welcome contributors and we really value the time you take to work with us on this project.

*Privacy Bot* is a project empowering users of the Internet by making privacy
policies accessible. Knowing what private data you give away when using a
website or service should be easy to understand and read. The aims are:

* Create a central repository of knowledge about privacy policies.
* Provide the tools to: gather, persist and analyze the policies.
* Make it easy for other people to build upon the data and tools to empower
  users.
* Allow monitoring of updates made to policies and quickly grasp the
  implications.

To ease the onboarding process, we have gathered and created issues in our issue tracker. Please take a look at the [opened issues](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/privacy-bot/issues).


## How to submit changes

Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository!
 
1. **Notify others by commenting on the issue**. By commenting on the issue, you
   will initiate a discussion around possible solutions and also communicate to
   other contributors that you started working on it. This will avoid having
   several people starting working on the same thing.
2. **[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository**. This makes your own version of this project you can edit and use.
3. **[Make your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes)**! You can do this in the GitHub interface on your own local machine (we *strongly recommend that you create a new branch* to make your changes). Once you're happy with your changes...
4. **Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)**. This opens a discussion around your project and lets the project lead know you are proposing changes.

## How to report bugs

* Conceptual design,
* Code,
* Spelling or formatting,
* or anything else we haven't yet thought of.

If you notice a bug, please raise an issue and label it with the label `bug`. Then anyone in community can get right on it, and everything gets fixed faster.
