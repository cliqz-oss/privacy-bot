## Data Mining
This means we should be able (ideally)  to find the privacy policy of any domain. There are several levels that are already adressed: 

- Automatically identify possible `url_canditates` for privacy policies.
- Fetch all `url_candidates`.
- Apply heuristics on the content.
- Store the fetched pages that qualify.
